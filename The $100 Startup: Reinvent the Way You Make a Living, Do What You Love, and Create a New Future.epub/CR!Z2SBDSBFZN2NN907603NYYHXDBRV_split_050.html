<p class="calibre11"><span><span class="calibre41"><span class="bold1">T</span></span></span>here’s an old saying about the combined knowledge of the pope and a peasant being greater than the knowledge of only the pope. In this case, I felt like the peasant learning from one hundred popes. After a decade of fumbling along, I know how to operate my own business, but crafting a narrative around the lessons of so many other people required me to learn much more than I could contribute by myself.</p>
<p class="calibre42">The hundred-plus case studies I focused on for the final draft (as well as the 1,400 other people who submitted stories and info) deserve my greatest thanks. They were patient with my numerous surveys, requests for additional info, and continual follow-ups. Being willing to share financial information about their business was especially generous. I had planned to gently push for access to finances if needed, but in most cases I didn’t have to push—almost everyone was willing and open to share whatever information would help others.</p>
<p class="calibre42">I do most of my other writing without access to an outside editor, a situation which has numerous advantages, but also a key disadvantage: Sometimes I get tired and take the easy way out. Fortunately, that strategy wasn’t an option here, all thanks to Rick Horgan, leader of the Crown team that published the book. Rick worked diligently and held my feet to the fire time after time, making for a much better finished product. I’m also grateful to Tina Constable and everyone else at Crown, and to my tireless literary agent, David Fugate.</p>
<p class="calibre42"><a class="calibre43"></a>Dave Navarro first gave me the analogy of a product launch being like a Hollywood movie. Jason Fried was the first person I heard say “Failure is overrated.” I’ve undoubtedly borrowed other concepts and ideas, so if I’ve stolen your idea, consider it an act of unintentional flattery.</p>
<p class="calibre42">I continue to learn every day from Seth Godin, Chris Brogan, friends and colleagues in the <em class="calibre14">LifeRemix</em> network, Scott Harrison, Gary Parker, and Susan Parker.</p>
<p class="calibre42">Jolie Guillebeau, my wife and chief proofreader, patiently endured repeated discussions about hustling and bad franchises. Many sections of the book were greatly improved thanks to her insight. Critical readings of the text were further accompanied by my four-pawed assistant Libby (aka “The Liberator”). Libby is also responsible for moderating comments on my blog—a tough job for someone who sleeps approximately twenty-two hours a day.</p>
<p class="calibre42">Wherever I go, I work closely with Reese Spykerman, superstar designer, and Nicky Hajal, genius developer. On this project, I’m also grateful for the collaboration with Mike Rohde, who made the fun illustrations you can see throughout this book. Special thanks to Stephanie D. Zito for last-minute cover-art consultation.</p>
<p class="calibre42">Every summer, the World Domination Summit action team puts on a weekend adventure like no other, and I’m thrilled to be along for the ride. All of my work is for and sustained by the AONC community, which greatly inspires me with their stories of change and adventure.</p>
<p class="calibre42">Finally, I offer my appreciation and gratitude to you, the reader. I hope you found these pages worthwhile.
