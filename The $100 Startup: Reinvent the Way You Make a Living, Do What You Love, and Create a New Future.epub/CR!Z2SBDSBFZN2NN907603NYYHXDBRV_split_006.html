<p class="calibre11"><span><span class="calibre41"><span class="bold1">I</span></span></span>magine a life where all your time is spent on the things you want to do.</p>
<p class="calibre42">Imagine giving your greatest attention to a project you create yourself, instead of working as a cog in a machine that exists to make other people rich.</p>
<p class="calibre42">Imagine handing a letter to your boss that reads, “Dear Boss, I’m writing to let you know that your services are no longer required. Thanks for everything, but I’ll be doing things my own way now.”</p>
<p class="calibre42">Imagine that today is your final day of working for anyone other than yourself. What if—very soon, not in some distant, undefined future—you prepare for work by firing up a laptop in your home office, walking into a storefront you’ve opened, phoning a client who trusts you for helpful advice, or otherwise doing what <em class="calibre14">you</em> want instead of what someone tells you to do?</p>
<p class="calibre42">All over the world, and in many different ways, thousands of people are doing exactly that. They are rewriting the rules of work, becoming their own bosses, and creating a new future.</p>
<p class="calibre42"><a class="calibre43"></a>This new model of doing business is well under way for these unexpected entrepreneurs, most of whom have never thought of themselves as businessmen and businesswomen. It’s a <em class="calibre14">microbusiness</em> revolution—a way of earning a good living while crafting a life of independence and purpose.</p>
<p class="calibre42">Other books chronicle the rise of Internet startups, complete with rants about venture capital and tales of in-house organic restaurants. Other guides tell you how to write eighty-page business plans that no one will ever read and that don’t resemble how an actual business operates anyway.</p>
<p class="calibre42">This book is different, and it has two key themes: <em class="calibre14">freedom</em> and <em class="calibre14">value</em>. Freedom is what we’re all looking for, and value is the way to achieve it.</p>
