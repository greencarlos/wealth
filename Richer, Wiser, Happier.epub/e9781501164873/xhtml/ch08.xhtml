<p class="chsub">How to invest better, think better, and live better by adopting Charlie Munger’s strategy of systematically reducing standard stupidities</p>

<p class="chepiattn">—Charlie Munger</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="noindent">I have traveled three thousand miles for a ten-minute interview with Charlie Munger. I arrive an hour early for my audience with him and wait in a state of nervous excitement to be summoned. It’s February 15, 2017, and he is here in downtown Los Angeles for the annual meeting of the Daily Journal Corporation. Munger, who is the chairman of this obscure newspaper publisher, is better known as Berkshire Hathaway’s billionaire vice chairman and Warren Buffett’s partner for more than <span aria-label="page 200" id="page_200" role="doc-pagebreak"/>forty years. Born in 1924, he is one-half of the greatest investment team that ever lived.</p>
<p class="indent">Munger has agreed to speak with me in private shortly before the Daily Journal meeting begins. So I’m standing outside a conference room in the company’s nondescript headquarters, watching as the lobby fills with hundreds of his devotees, including prominent investors such as Li Lu, Mohnish Pabrai, François Rochon, Whitney Tilson, Christopher Davis, and Francis Chou. It’s a running joke that almost nobody here cares about the Daily Journal. When attendees enter the building, they sign in to a book that asks how many shares they own. For almost all, the answer is zero. Like me, they have come from far and wide to bask in the caustic wit and wisdom of this ninety-three-year-old icon.</p>
<p class="indent">The prospect of interviewing Munger is both thrilling and unnerving, given his reputation as a fearsomely clever curmudgeon who detects flaws and failings with devastating clarity. Buffett once declared, “Charlie can analyze and evaluate any kind of deal faster and more accurately than any man alive. He sees any valid weakness in sixty seconds.” Buffett has also said that Munger boasts “the best thirty-second mind in the world.… He sees the essence of everything before you can even finish the sentence.” Microsoft’s cofounder, Bill Gates, has said that Munger is “the broadest thinker I have ever encountered.”</p>
<p class="indent">Munger’s mind inspires awe among people who are not normally inclined toward hero worship. Pabrai, who claims that Munger is “a quantum leap above Warren” in terms of intelligence, chuckles at the memory of hearing him speak onstage alongside a Nobel Prize–winning scientist who was “Caltech’s biggest brain. That guy looked like a shrimp who didn’t know shit. You could see the contrast: dumbass on one side, <i>real</i> brain on the other.” Pabrai adds that Munger’s innate gifts gave him a “huge head start,” which he’s extended by synthesizing several books a week, roving voraciously over a multitude of disciplines. That combination of “incredible wiring” and “intense data input makes it appear like the guy has been living for three hundred years.”</p>
<p class="indent">But there’s another reason to feel trepidation as I gird myself to meet Munger. Even his most ardent admirers will admit that he can be brusque to the point of rudeness. Chou laughs as he tells me the <span aria-label="page 201" id="page_201" role="doc-pagebreak"/>tale of a fellow money manager who traveled regularly to Omaha and California to hear Munger speak. One day, says Chou, this friend of his ran into Munger in an elevator and exclaimed, “Charlie, you’ve been such an inspiration to me! I’ve learned so much from you over so many years!” Munger dismissed him with a single word: “So?” And then he walked away.</p>
<p class="indent">Bill Miller recalls running into Munger on a street in New York: “I said, ‘Charlie!’ And he looks at me and says, ‘Who the hell are you?’ ” Miller introduced himself and reminded Munger that they’d once met at a behavioral finance event. “He’s like, ‘Oh, yeah!’ And he said to his wife, ‘Why don’t you go on to the hotel and I’ll walk around with Bill for a while.…’ We probably walked around for an hour, just talking about stuff. But it was funny. ‘Who the hell are you?’ ”</p>
<p class="indent">But my favorite story of Munger’s flamboyant failures in diplomacy comes from Buffett, who shared it with Pabrai and Guy Spier over lunch in 2008. Munger, who has a glass eye, visited the Department of Motor Vehicles, where a hapless bureaucrat made the unfortunate error of asking him, “Do you still have just one good eye?” Munger replied, “No. I’ve grown a new one.”</p>
<p class="indent">Pabrai had assured me that Munger is kinder and gentler than his reputation might suggest: “Charlie is a very soft, caring guy. He has a hard exterior. But once you get past it, he’s a beautiful person.” Munger’s daughter, Molly, who is a lawyer and a philanthropist, adds that he has mellowed: “He has an acerbic edge. I think when he was younger, it was more pronounced.”</p>
<p class="indent">Nonetheless, I took the precaution of preparing obsessively for our brief encounter. And what I began to realize while poring over decades of his speeches, writings, and other musings is that Munger adopts one practice that all of us would be wise to clone: <b>He strives consistently to reduce his capacity for “foolish thinking,” “idiotic behavior,” “unoriginal error,” and “standard stupidities.”</b></p>
<p class="indent">For example, at another shareholder meeting back in 2015, he ridiculed the popular delusion in academic circles that the market is so efficient that nobody can beat it. “I knew it was bullshit,” he said, adding that he also “never believed there was a talking snake in the Garden of Eden. I had a gift for recognizing twaddle. I don’t have any won<span aria-label="page 202" id="page_202" role="doc-pagebreak"/>derful insights that other people don’t have. I just have slightly more consistently than others avoided idiocy. Other people are trying to be smart. All <i>I’m</i> trying to be is non-idiotic. I find that all you have to do to get ahead in life is to be non-idiotic and live a long time. It’s harder to be non-idiotic than most people think.”</p>
<p class="indent">It’s a curious paradox that one of the smartest people on earth focuses primarily on avoiding stupidity. But as we shall see, this is an extraordinarily effective strategy in markets and life.</p>
<h2 class="h2x">The Non-idiot’s Guide to Life</h2>
<p class="noindent">The door to the conference room opens and Munger greets me in a low, croaky voice: “Nice to see you. Sit down.” I find myself sitting almost knee to knee with the sage. Several people are talking noisily as they leave the room, but Munger has no trouble tuning out the hubbub and focusing. He has white hair and powerful spectacles. His dark suit looks baggy on his thin and frail body. To my relief, his manner is surprisingly benevolent.</p>
<p class="indent">There’s no time for small talk, so I cut straight to the chase. I tell Munger that I regard him as “the Grand Master of Stupidity Reduction,” and I ask him why he focuses so much attention on avoiding common errors and predictable patterns of irrationality. “Because it works,” he says. “It works. It’s counterintuitive that you go at the problem backward. If you try and be smart, it’s difficult. If you just go around and identify all of the disasters and say, ‘What caused that?’ and try to avoid it, it turns out to be a very simple way to find opportunities and avoid troubles.”</p>
<p class="indent">Munger’s approach of solving problems backward was influenced by Carl Gustav Jacobi, a nineteenth-century algebraist who famously said, “Invert, always invert.” But Munger tells me that he also honed this mental habit of inversion with help from his friend Garrett Hardin, an ecologist who shared his fascination with the dire repercussions of shoddy thinking: “Hardin’s basic idea was, if somebody asks you how to <i>help</i> India, just say, ‘What could I do to really <i>ruin</i> India?’ And you think through all of the things you could do to ruin India, and then you reverse it and say, ‘Now, I won’t do <i>those</i>.’ It’s counterintuitive but <span aria-label="page 203" id="page_203" role="doc-pagebreak"/>it really helps you to <i>reverse</i> these issues. It’s a more complete way of thinking a problem through.”</p>
<p class="indent">In 1986, Munger delivered a commencement speech at a Los Angeles prep school attended by several of his eight children and stepchildren. Instead of trotting out the usual bland platitudes about the secrets of success and happiness, he provided an inspired illustration of how to apply the principle of inversion. He gave the students a series of “prescriptions for guaranteed misery in life,” recommending that they should be unreliable, avoid compromise, harbor resentments, seek revenge, indulge in envy, “ingest chemicals,” become addicted to alcohol, neglect to “learn vicariously from the good and bad experience of others,” cling defiantly to their existing beliefs, and “stay down” when struck by the “first, second, or third severe reverse in the battle of life.”</p>
<p class="indent">When I ask Munger how to apply this method of thinking to practical problems such as deciding whether to get married or buy a particular stock, he recommends asking, “ ‘Is this going to be a disaster?’ instead of asking, ‘Is it going to be wonderful?’ Finding out what’s wrong and trying to avoid it is different from finding out what’s good and trying to get it. You have to do both, of course, in life. But this inversion of looking for the trouble and trying to avoid it keeps you out of a lot of messes.… It’s a precaution. It’s like a checklist before you take off in an airplane.”</p>
<p class="indent">Similarly, if you’re looking to make a thoughtful investment in a well-managed fund, you might start by asking, “How can I invest blindly in a lousy fund that’s a disaster waiting to happen?” That question would lead you to list all of the pitfalls that investors routinely overlook—for example, outrageous fees, dangerous exposure to the most popular and priciest sectors of the market, and a recent streak of head-spinning returns that will almost surely prove unsustainable.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>This, then, is the first mental trick we should learn from Munger as a safeguard against stupidity: imagine a dreadful outcome; work backward by asking yourself what misguided actions might lead you to that sorry fate; and then scrupulously avoid that self-destructive behavior.</b> “Of course,” says Munger, “a lot of people are so interested in reaching for the prize that they don’t even <i>think</i> about the stupidities that might prevent them from getting it.”</p>
<p class="indent"><span aria-label="page 204" id="page_204" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Buffett and Munger have used inversion to avert many predictable and unpredictable disasters. Writing to Berkshire’s shareholders in 2009, Buffett discussed the art of inversion at length under the heading “What We Don’t Do.” For example, “Charlie and I avoid businesses whose futures we can’t evaluate, no matter how exciting their products may be,” sticking instead “with businesses whose profit picture for decades to come seems reasonably predictable.” Berkshire also holds vast quantities of cash, negating any need to be a “supplicant” in times of economic distress. Buffett also joked that “this inversion approach works on a less lofty level: Sing a country song in reverse, and you will quickly recover your car, house and wife.”</p>
<p class="indent">Like Buffett and Munger, all of the best investors I’ve encountered have extreme clarity about <i>what not to do</i>. Joel Tillinghast, who has beaten the Russell 2000 Index by 3.7 percentage points a year since 1989 as the manager of Fidelity’s Low-Priced Stock Fund, has been called “the most gifted stock picker of his generation” by Jim Lowell, editor of the <i>Fidelity Investor</i> newsletter. During an interview in Boston, I asked Tillinghast to explain his winning strategy. He responded by listing everything that he avoids. For example, he steers clear of development-stage biotech stocks, knowing that they’re likely to bring out the worst in him. He can’t make a valid earnings forecast because their “future is so murky.” Plus, biotech stocks are so volatile that they could trigger him to react emotionally. “I’m going to be crazy if I deal with biotech stocks,” he says. “So I’m <i>not</i> going to do biotech stocks.”</p>
<p class="indent">Tillinghast, a shy and timid math whiz who manages more than $40 billion in assets, has developed a plethora of defensive principles and practices, which have helped him to outperform—and outlast—almost all of his competitors. <b>For a start, he says, “Don’t pay too much. Don’t go for businesses that are prone to obsolescence and destruction. Don’t invest with crooks and idiots. Don’t invest in things you don’t understand.”</b></p>
<p class="indent">Tillinghast also steers clear of businesses that are deeply cyclical, heavily indebted, or faddish. He views “promotional management” and “aggressive accounting” as “red flags.” He shuns areas where he has no special insight or skill because nothing is more critical than “staying away from your ignorance.” He also refrains from talking “too pub<span aria-label="page 205" id="page_205" role="doc-pagebreak"/>licly or too frequently” about his holdings because that would make it harder to change his mind and admit when he was wrong. And he resists the urge to trade stocks actively, since that would generate onerous transaction costs and taxes, which would erode his returns.</p>
<p class="indent">What’s left once he’s eliminated all of those common causes of disappointment? A portfolio packed with undervalued, understandable, financially stable, profitable, and growing businesses run by honest people. His “most amazing” stock, Monster Beverage, has risen 1,000-fold.</p>
<p class="indent">Following Tillinghast’s example, we can all benefit from understanding the most popular recipes for failure. Think about why most investors mess up and, like him, <i>don’t do that</i>. “If you want to be superior, that’s difficult,” he says. “But what you <i>won’t</i> do is easier to control and more attainable.… I’m not going to lose fifteen pounds. But saying no to doughnuts, that’s easy for me.”</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, it’s worth noting that Munger’s method of solving problems backward is also an effective way to avert self-inflicted chaos in our personal lives. Markel’s co-CEO Tom Gayner offers the example of a husband who ventures out on the town without his wife. “I’m married to a lovely woman,” he says. “To be in a bar without her, by myself, under the influence of too much alcohol… creates a different set of temptations and circumstances than would be the case with being more moderate.” He recommends applying “the Munger inversion technique” by asking a simple question: “What would be a bad thing and how do I avoid that?” A reasonable answer, says Gayner, would be to have “two drinks instead of ten.”</p>
<p class="indent">Whether your goal is to be a terrific stock picker or a terrific spouse, it’s helpful to start by asking yourself how to be a terrible one. And then? <i>Invert, always invert</i>.</p>
<h2 class="h2x">The Collector of Inanities</h2>
<p class="noindent">While other billionaires collect art, vintage cars, and racehorses, Munger describes himself as a collector of “absurdities,” “asininities,” and “inanities.” His daughter Molly recalls listening in her youth to his many cautionary tales “about people doing stupid things,” which often <span aria-label="page 206" id="page_206" role="doc-pagebreak"/>included “a tinge of ingratitude and poor moral judgment.” A typical story would feature the cosseted heir to a fortune who turned with bitter resentment against his father. Molly Munger remarks, “It’s stupid at every level: ungrateful, self-sabotaging, unrealistic, egotistical.”</p>
<p class="indent"><b>This habit of actively collecting examples of other people’s foolish behavior is an invaluable antidote to idiocy. In fact, it’s the second great anti-stupidity technique we should learn from Munger.</b> It’s a perverse hobby that provides him with endless entertainment and insight, enabling him to catalog in his head all of the “boneheaded” moves to excise from his playbook. Anyone can benefit from this practice, he tells me, “but I don’t think you get it unless you have a certain temperament. A lot of what I do is not IQ. It’s something else. Temperament. Attitude. But I think it’s partly inherited”—like “quick hand-eye” coordination or “a capacity in tennis.”</p>
<p class="indent">Munger is spoiled for choice when it comes to collecting investment inanities. For example, he derides the tendency to listen to market predictions, comparing these feeble attempts at financial divination to the ancient art of inspecting sheep’s entrails to foretell the future. Another common error is “to buy a cyclical company at the top of the cycle. A lot of people just do it all the time, and the investment bankers, of course, will encourage them to buy any dumb thing that will give a commission.” These naive investors fail to realize that “the old cyclicality is going to come back,” trusting instead that the company’s upsurge “will keep going just because it’s <i>been</i> going. That’s a standard stupidity.”</p>
<p class="indent">Munger also collects examples of his own idiocy. When I attended Berkshire Hathaway’s annual meeting in 2017, he spoke candidly about two of the costliest mistakes of omission that he and Buffett have made. Munger confessed to the audience of some forty thousand Berkshire shareholders that “we failed you” by not buying Google. “We blew Walmart, too, when it was a total cinch.”</p>
<p class="indent">Most of us prefer to bury our mistakes far from public view. We’re not keen on admitting them to ourselves, either. But as Munger sees it, the more transparently he reviews his mistakes, the less likely he is to repeat them. <b>He once told Berkshire’s shareholders, “I like people admitting they were complete stupid horses’ asses. I know I’ll perform better if I rub my nose in my mistakes. This is a wonderful trick</b> <span aria-label="page 207" id="page_207" role="doc-pagebreak"/><b>to learn.” Indeed, it’s the third trick we must learn from him in our campaign to constrain our own stupidity.</b></p>
<p class="indent">Still, Munger doesn’t engage in gratuitous self-flagellation. He acknowledges his errors, learns the lessons, and moves forward without wallowing in regret. “We were active enough so we had some mistakes to remember,” he says. “We learned a lot vicariously because it’s so much cheaper. But we also learned a lot from unpleasant experience.” Some of Berkshire’s mistakes have stung, including its 1993 purchase of Dexter Shoe Co., which was annihilated by low-cost Chinese rivals. But none of those errors have been catastrophic in the grand scheme.</p>
<p class="indent">No investor I’ve met has internalized the importance of avoiding catastrophe more deeply than Fred Martin, the founder of a Minneapolis-based firm called Disciplined Growth Investors. It’s a priority that pervades every area of his life—from managing money to flying his private plane. Like Munger, Martin has made it a central focus to dissect other people’s errors. “You don’t have to do it with a sense of thrill,” he says. “It’s just to learn.” For Martin, this way of thinking began as a survival strategy during four years as a US navy officer in the Vietnam War—a searing experience that showed him the devastating consequences of preventable mistakes.</p>
<p class="indent">Martin joined the navy in June 1969 after graduating from business school at Dartmouth. That month, an American destroyer, the USS <i>Frank E. Evans</i>, collided with an Australian aircraft carrier in the South China Sea. It was 3:00 a.m. and the destroyer’s commanding officer was asleep, leaving two inexperienced lieutenants in charge. The ship turned the wrong way, strayed into the carrier’s path, and was cut in two. The front half of the destroyer sank in minutes, with much of the crew trapped inside. In all, seventy-four people died. Four officers were court-martialed. An investigation concluded that “the tragic event… can be ascribed to error in individual human judgment.”</p>
<p class="indent">Martin still remembers the horror he felt while staring at a photograph of the vessel’s severed remains: “It’s a shocking picture because the ship stops about halfway. It’s literally like a welder took a torch and just cut off half of the ship.” But what made the catastrophe unforgettable was that it could have happened to him. Martin was promoted to lieutenant on another destroyer and became one of the most junior <span aria-label="page 208" id="page_208" role="doc-pagebreak"/>officers in naval history to be cleared for command at sea. At twenty-four, he was responsible for 240 lives whenever his captain was asleep. How could he forget the two luckless lieutenants on the <i>Frank E. Evans</i>—those “poor kids” whose mistakes sank their ship?</p>
<p class="indent">Night after night, Martin stood watch when he was exhausted from lack of sleep. The ship’s radio would be blaring, the engine room would be calling him about some problem or other, and they were steaming in the dark through treacherous waters. The situation “was ripe for terrible mistakes,” he says. “Man, you were tired.… You were just trying to survive.” One habit that he developed was to walk out on the wing of the bridge whenever his ship was about to turn, so he could confirm with his own eyes that the course was clear. That “simple rule” that you must “look before you turn” was “not part of our training,” says Martin. “But it should have been.” Looking back now in his seventies, he realizes how ingrained in him that wary attitude became.</p>
<p class="indent">Martin left the navy in 1973. “I came out deadly serious,” he recalls. The stock market had long intrigued him. He’d bought his first stock when he was twelve and even had a subscription to the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> delivered in infrequent batches to his ship. So he found a job as an equity analyst at a bank in Minneapolis. It didn’t take long to discover that most members of his new profession lacked the vigilance that had protected him and his shipmates in wartime. His own father, a successful stockbroker with a talent for sales, lost half a million dollars that year when the brokerage firm that employed him went bust. He’d staked a reckless portion of the family’s wealth on that one business and missed all the warning signs that it was falling apart.</p>
<p class="indent">Several years later, his father made a tidy profit on a stock that Martin had recommended. When they spoke about it on the phone, Martin recognized in a moment of awful clarity that his father was “a wonderful man” but “a terrible investor”—“hyperactive,” “impulsive,” “always looking for the quick hit.… He was too excited. So I realized that he didn’t know what he was doing.”</p>
<p class="indent">Martin’s investment career began at a time of mass excitement when rationality was in short supply. Led by the Nifty Fifty, the market went nuts in 1973, and he saw that valuations had become unhinged from reality. He recalls analyzing a hot stock with no earnings and telling his <span aria-label="page 209" id="page_209" role="doc-pagebreak"/>boss that he saw little value there: “And he said, ‘Ah, don’t worry about it, Fred. It’s a <i>faith</i> stock.’ Of course, the stock gets destroyed.” When the market collapsed in 1974, “all the hotshots” were “washed out” of the business, says Martin. But he could see that the relationship between price and value had now swung to the opposite extreme: “It was an incredible buying opportunity.… All you had to do was have the guts to invest.” As a devout saver, he had the cash to buy a slew of bargain stocks, including FlightSafety International—“my first ten-bagger.”</p>
<p class="indent">Those formative experiences of market folly reinforced the lesson that Martin had learned at sea. <b>Nothing matters more than averting obvious errors with the potential for catastrophic consequences.</b> But in the decades that followed, he would observe the same pattern again and again: heedless risk followed by unnecessary disaster.</p>
<p class="indent">For example, during the internet and telecom craze of the late 1990s, some of his clients jumped ship and invested a major portion of their life savings with Jim Oelschlager, a gunslinging tech evangelist who, at his peak, attracted more than $30 billion in assets. Oelschlager ran narrowly focused funds filled with overpriced highfliers such as Cisco Systems. When the bubble burst in 2000, Cisco lost $400 billion in market value. As Martin had feared, gung-ho investors who were overexposed to such ultra-aggressive funds were “immolated.”</p>
<p class="indent">Another client phoned to ask if Martin could guarantee a 12 percent return “every year without fail.” Martin told him that stocks are too volatile to promise that level of consistency: “And he said, ‘Aww, a guy in New York—a genius named Madoff—won’t tell anybody how he does it, but <i>he</i> does 12 percent like clockwork.” So the client entrusted his savings to Bernie Madoff, operator of the biggest Ponzi scheme in history. The lesson? “If people can’t tell you how they do it” and “you can’t understand what they do,” says Martin, “that’s probably not the best spot to be in.” <b>His “golden rule for risk management” is simple: “Know what you own.”</b></p>
<p class="indent">As Martin sees it, the best defense against disaster is to “understand the core principles” of investing and then have the “basic discipline” never to violate these “financial laws of gravity.” The most essential law is always to maintain a margin of safety, which stems from buying assets for less than they are worth. Martin, who coauthored a book <span aria-label="page 210" id="page_210" role="doc-pagebreak"/>titled <i>Benjamin Graham and the Power of Growth Stocks</i>, warns, “You’re <i>going</i> to screw up. The question is, Can you recover?” Graham’s concept of the margin of safety helps you to “contain” your mistakes “so they’re not too big. That’s how you recover.”</p>
<p class="indent">Martin isn’t advocating that we avoid risk. On the contrary, “You need to take risks if you’re going to achieve returns.” But they should always be “considered risks.” Martin, who manages $6 billion and requires a minimum of $15 million to open a separate account, specializes in a racy niche: small and midsize companies growing at a rapid rate. But he insists on investing at cheap or fair prices, based on his estimate of their intrinsic value now and in seven years. It’s “an article of faith” that a company’s intrinsic value and its market value will converge over time. There are “two sources of return for a stock,” he says. “One is the growth in intrinsic value. The other is the truing up” between the stock price and the “real value” of the underlying business. He has no idea when that truing up will occur. But his average holding period is a decade.</p>
<p class="indent">Martin will buy a stock only if it’s cheap enough to generate a high expected rate of return over the next seven years. For mid-cap stocks, he requires a minimum rate of return of 12 percent a year. For small caps, which have a greater risk of failure, he requires a minimum of 15 percent a year. Why does this matter? Because those standardized requirements force him <i>systematically</i> to buy stocks only when they are a sufficiently attractive proposition. <b>As Martin learned in the navy, “adherence to process” is an indispensable safeguard: “Always honor it because that’s going to keep you out of trouble.”</b><sup class="sup"><a href="footnotes.xhtml#footnote-006" id="footnote-006-backlink">I</a></sup> <b>This idea of adopting a few standard practices and unbendable rules is our fourth technique for reducing stupidity.</b> Buffett and Munger may not need formal constraints to maintain their discipline. But you and I are not them.</p>
<p class="indent">Martin has another rule that he observes “religiously” as a protection against calamity. He never invests more than 3 percent of his assets in a stock at the time of purchase. Typically, he owns forty-five to fifty <span aria-label="page 211" id="page_211" role="doc-pagebreak"/>stocks. Is that too conservative? Absolutely. But it hasn’t prevented him from beating the indexes by a wide margin over decades, and it <i>has</i> prevented no end of misery.</p>
<p class="indent">Just consider the case of Bill Ackman and Bob Goldfarb, two gifted investors who made colossal bets on Valeant Pharmaceuticals. The company lost 95 percent of its value amid scandals over its deceptive accounting and obscene overpricing of drugs. Goldfarb, who had more than 30 percent of the Sequoia Fund riding on Valeant, retired ignominiously, his illustrious record ruined by one mistake. Ackman lost $4 billion. “Apparently, he’s a brilliant guy,” says Martin. “But, man, that was amateur hour.… He doesn’t have to take those kinds of extreme positions.” For Martin, it’s especially instructive to study “financial disasters” involving “the guys that are really good” because “you want to keep reminding yourself of how difficult this business is.… Humility is extremely important in investing. Always, <i>always</i> think about your own limitations.”</p>
<p class="indent">This guarded attitude toward risk extends beyond the realm of investing. Munger often preaches about the importance of avoiding behavior with marginal upside and devastating downside. He once observed, “Three things ruin people: drugs, liquor, and leverage.” The category of activities that exhibit this type of dangerous asymmetry also includes drunk driving, extramarital affairs, and cheating on taxes or expense reports. Regardless of our moral views, these are foolish bets.</p>
<p class="indent">Martin’s survival—as a naval officer, money manager, and experienced pilot—is no accident. He focuses relentlessly on the fundamental priority of “not letting your disasters kill you.” These days, he flies a secondhand Gulfstream jet, which he bought after the price tumbled from about $14 million to $5.25 million. “It’s just fabulous,” he says. “It goes like a scalded dog.” Still, he describes himself and his company’s chief pilot as “the two biggest cowards in the sky.”</p>
<p class="indent">They have one “ironclad rule” that’s kept them out of trouble for many years: If either of them doesn’t have “a warm and fuzzy feeling” in his stomach during a trip, “he speaks up and we don’t keep going. We turn around.… There’s no argument about it.” Martin recalls postponing a critical meeting with a major client in Florida because of the danger that his plane might be running low on fuel: “I was unwilling <span aria-label="page 212" id="page_212" role="doc-pagebreak"/>to violate the margin of safety.… Being late for a meeting is one thing. Crashing the plane and dying is something completely different.”</p>
<p class="indent">Martin has adapted that rule so that it’s also integral to his investment process. He has given two trusted colleagues the power to veto any of his stock picks before he makes the purchase—another systematic safeguard against his capacity for oversight and overconfidence.</p>
<p class="indent">Martin’s readiness to recognize his fallibility has served him well, not only protecting him from himself but positioning him to profit from other investors’ failures. Several years ago, a high-fee hedge fund that had once managed billions closed after performing poorly. Martin swooped in and bought $500,000 worth of “gorgeous” office furniture from the defunct firm for $25,000. “Let’s never forget,” he says, “the value of being the last man standing.”<sup class="sup"><a href="footnotes.xhtml#footnote-005" id="footnote-005-backlink">II</a></sup></p>
<h2 class="h2x">Beware of  Your Brain</h2>
<p class="noindent">One of the thorniest problems we face as investors is that the human brain is ill-equipped to make rational decisions. Our judgment is frequently torpedoed by emotions such as fear, greed, jealousy, and impatience; by prejudices that distort our perception of reality; by our susceptibility to serpentine sales pitches and peer pressure; and by our habit of acting on flawed or incomplete information. As the evolutionary biologist Robert Trivers writes in <i>The Folly of Fools: The Logic of Deceit and Self-Deception in Human Life</i>, “our marvelous organs of perception” enable us to obtain information that our minds systematically “degrade and destroy.”</p>
<p class="indent">In the 1990s, Munger confronted this problem in three speeches about “the psychology of human misjudgment.” In 2005, he wrote an expanded version for inclusion in a collection of his greatest hits, <i>Poor Charlie’s Almanack: The Wit and Wisdom of Charles T. Munger</i>. His talk, which Nick Sleep hails as “the finest investment speech ever,” is a <span aria-label="page 213" id="page_213" role="doc-pagebreak"/>dazzling display of intellectual chutzpah. Munger, who’d never taken a psychology course and had read three textbooks on the subject, compiled a list of twenty-five “psychological tendencies” that cause our minds to malfunction, giving them evocative names such as Excessive Self-Regard Tendency, Twaddle Tendency, and Simple, Pain-Avoiding Psychological Denial. He even had the temerity to criticize academic psychologists for failing to understand their own subject.</p>
<p class="indent">Munger’s compilation of “standard thinking errors” provides him—and us—with a practical checklist of pitfalls to avoid. “The trick here is to first understand them and then train yourself out of them,” says Sleep. “Articulating this stuff is easy. Internalizing it is not. That’s the hard work.” But it’s essential because “the most enduring advantages are psychological.”</p>
<p class="indent">Munger starts with a tendency of such importance that almost all of us underestimate its significance: the role that incentives play in “changing cognition and behavior.” He quotes his hero, Benjamin Franklin, who said, “If you would persuade, appeal to interest and not to reason.” Munger writes, “This maxim is a wise guide to a great and simple precaution in life: Never, ever, think about something else when you should be thinking about the power of incentives.”</p>
<p class="indent">Incentives are pivotal in every area of life, whether it’s motivating employees or cajoling the most recalcitrant of adversaries: your children. Munger notes that the Soviet Union suffered from its Communist leaders’ “foolish and willful ignorance of the superpower of rewards,” which led them to disincentivize much productive work. He also warns about the “incentive-caused bias” of salespeople, which can lead “a pretty decent fellow” to drift “into immoral behavior in order to get what he wants.” As an antidote, Munger offers this tip: “Especially fear professional advice when it is especially good for the adviser.”</p>
<p class="indent">The financial world is so riddled with conflicts of interest that we should always be wary of the mind-warping influence of incentives on anyone peddling products or advice. If, say, you’re thinking of buying a fund or an annuity, you need to know precisely how your “advisers” are rewarded for their recommendations. It’s equally imperative to assess whether a fund manager’s incentives are adequately aligned with <i>your</i> best interests.</p>
<p class="indent"><span aria-label="page 214" id="page_214" role="doc-pagebreak"/>In 1998, I wrote a damning article about the Kaufmann Fund, which had hit the jackpot as a small fund making big bets on tiny stocks. Stellar returns and relentless advertising transformed it into a different beast. With nearly $6 billion in assets, it could no longer focus aggressively on small caps, and its results deteriorated. Still, its two managers raked in $186 million in fees over three years, despite lagging the S&amp;P 500 by more than 50 percentage points. One even admitted to me that he had none of his own money in the fund. <i>That’s</i> misalignment. All these years later, I’m not shocked to see that the fund still charges an egregious expense ratio of 1.98 percent a year. With $7.5 billion in assets, it’s a fantastic fee machine. Given the economies of scale, wouldn’t it be fairer to charge less? Sure. But who would benefit? Only its shareholders.</p>
<p class="indent">By contrast, Martin accepted long ago that he’s incapable of investing large sums in small stocks without hurting his shareholders’ returns. So he closed his small-cap portfolio to new investors in 2006 when his firm’s assets in that area amounted to only $400 million. That self-restraint has cost him tens of millions in fees, but it has served his existing clients admirably. It’s always revealing to see how investors structure their incentives. As vice chairman of Berkshire, which has a market value of more than $500 billion, Munger receives a salary of $100,000. As chairman of the Daily Journal, he receives no salary. He profits from performance, not fees.<sup class="sup"><a href="footnotes.xhtml#footnote-004" id="footnote-004-backlink">III</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Munger often remarks on how critical it is to partner with honorable and unselfish people, while avoiding those with “perverse incentives.” He was appalled by the greed that precipitated the 2008–09 financial crisis, with Wall Street’s best and brightest engaged in exploits such as repackaging subprime mortgages to create pestilent bonds with pristine credit ratings. It’s easy to rationalize tawdry behavior, especially when it’s legal and others are feeding from the same trough. But <span aria-label="page 215" id="page_215" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Munger recommends a higher moral standard, which involves saying, “This is beneath me.”</p>
<p class="indent">Another cognitive danger that Munger highlights in his speech is the “tendency to quickly remove doubt” by rushing to make a decision—a habit that’s often triggered by stress. This Doubt-Avoidance Tendency makes evolutionary sense, given that our ancestors had to act decisively in the face of urgent threats. But mental shortcuts that lead investors to make impetuous decisions often end in disaster. To make matters worse, we also fall victim to what Munger calls Inconsistency-Avoidance Tendency, which inclines us to resist new information and insights that might challenge our conclusions, no matter how hastily we reached them.</p>
<p class="indent">Munger provides a vivid analogy: “When one sperm gets into a human egg, there’s an automatic shut-off device that bars any other sperm from getting in. The human mind tends strongly toward the same sort of result.” <b>The reluctance to reexamine our views and change our minds is one of the greatest impediments to rational thinking. Instead of keeping an open mind, we tend consciously and unconsciously to prioritize information that</b> <span class="bolditalic">reinforces</span> <b>what we believe.</b></p>
<p class="indent">The mistake of clinging blindly to our existing convictions can be exacerbated by several other psychological tendencies. Excessive Self-Regard Tendency leads us to overestimate our talents, opinions, and decisions. Overoptimism Tendency lures us into careless acts of financial hubris, especially when all is going well and we’re feeling clever. And Simple, Pain-Avoiding Psychological Denial causes us to distort facts when “the reality is too painful to bear.” That helps to explain why so many investors fool themselves into believing that they can outpace index funds in the long run, despite lacking the requisite skills, temperament, or control over costs. Munger likes to quote the ancient Greek orator Demosthenes, who observed, “Nothing is easier than self-deceit. For what each man wishes, that he also believes to be true.”</p>
<p class="indent">If the human mind is such a dirty trickster, how can we expect to make rational investment decisions? First, we need to acknowledge that this insidious threat exists. As Ben Graham wrote, “The investor’s chief problem—and even his worst enemy—is likely to be himself.”</p>
<p class="indent">We also need to be wary of our own distinctive psychological ten<span aria-label="page 216" id="page_216" role="doc-pagebreak"/>dencies, which can skew our judgment in predictable directions. Howard Marks, who is inclined to worry, tells me, “If your thinking is heavily colored by wishful thinking, then your probability assignments will be biased toward favorable.… If you’re given to fear, then you’ll be biased toward the negative.… No one is going to say, ‘This is my prediction and it’s probably wrong.’ But you <i>must</i> say, ‘This is my expectation and I have to be aware of the likelihood that it’s colored by my emotional bias.’ And you have to <i>resist</i> it. For me, that means not to chicken out when the going gets tough.”</p>
<p class="indent">One way that Munger guards against irrationality is by emulating the “extreme objectivity” of scientists such as Charles Darwin, Albert Einstein, and Richard Feynman. When I ask what we can learn from them about how to think through a problem, Munger says, “They were all very hard on themselves.… They <i>worked</i> at reducing stupidity. They <i>cared</i> about thinking it through properly. They had long attention spans and they worked, worked, worked to avoid the stupidities.”</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Munger particularly admires their unflinching determination to seek out “disconfirming evidence” that might disprove even their most cherished beliefs. This mental habit, which takes many different forms, is our fifth defense against idiocy.</b></p>
<p class="indent">For example, Darwin refused to allow his Christian faith or the conventional wisdom among his fellow naturalists to impede his shocking conclusions about evolution. In the introduction to his 1859 book <i>On the Origin of Species</i>, he discards a sacrosanct belief drawn from the Bible, declaring, “I can entertain no doubt, after the most deliberate study and dispassionate judgment of which I am capable, that the view which most naturalists entertain, and which I formerly entertained—namely, that each species has been independently created—is erroneous.”</p>
<p class="indent"><b>That willingness to welcome the discovery of our own errors is an inestimable advantage.</b> Munger nurtures it by applauding himself whenever he succeeds in demolishing one of his entrenched beliefs, so that “ignorance removal” becomes a source of satisfaction, not shame. He once remarked, “If Berkshire has made modest progress, a good deal of it is because Warren and I are very good at destroying our own best-loved ideas. Any year that you don’t destroy one of your best-loved ideas is probably a wasted year.”</p>
<p class="indent"><span aria-label="page 217" id="page_217" role="doc-pagebreak"/>One year stands out because the best-loved idea they destroyed made way for an even better idea, which would alter Berkshire’s course dramatically over the next five decades. In 1972, Buffett and Munger were presented with the opportunity to acquire See’s Candies, a Californian maker of chocolate, for $30 million—a premium price of almost four times net tangible assets. Munger thought it was reasonable, given the company’s powerful brand, devoted customer base, and ability to raise prices. But Buffett was a cheapskate who had made a fortune investing in mediocre businesses at such low prices that he could hardly lose. He’d learned this “cigar butt” strategy from Graham, his beloved mentor. So how could he forsake it and pay for quality?</p>
<p class="indent">Looking back in Berkshire’s 2014 annual report, Buffett recalled, “My misguided caution could have scuttled a terrific purchase. But, luckily, the sellers decided to take our $25 million bid.” Munger has said that he and Buffett would have walked away from See’s if the price had been $100,000 higher: “We were that dumb back then.” Since 1972, See’s has earned about $2 billion in pretax profits, vindicating their new belief that it’s worth paying more for great businesses.</p>
<p class="indent">That realization changed everything, leading them to invest in world-class companies such as Coca-Cola. Their appreciation for intangible assets, including brand loyalty and exceptional management, has continued to evolve, allowing them to pay even richer premiums to acquire unique businesses such as ISCAR and Precision Castparts. In his 2014 annual report, Buffett credited Munger with curing him of his addiction to cigar butts and establishing “the design of today’s Berkshire. The blueprint he gave me was simple: Forget what you know about buying fair businesses at wonderful prices; instead, buy wonderful businesses at fair prices.”</p>
<p class="indent">None of this would have happened if Buffett and Munger weren’t so committed to challenging their beliefs. Munger has always disdained “heavy ideology” in everything from investing to politics, denouncing it as “one of the most extreme distorters of human cognition.” Having practiced law before Buffett persuaded him to change professions, Munger consciously trained himself to study counterarguments so he can articulate them as accurately as if they were his own views. He also makes a point of reading articles by cogent thinkers with whom he dis<span aria-label="page 218" id="page_218" role="doc-pagebreak"/>agrees, including the <i>New York Times</i> columnist Paul Krugman. Most of us favor media sources that echo our social and political prejudices. But Munger’s example led me to adopt a simple, mind-expanding practice of reading columns in the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> that counter my own biases.</p>
<p class="indent">Another practical way to insure that our weak ideas and lazy prejudices don’t go unchallenged is to find intellectual sparring partners who aren’t afraid to disagree with us. Buffett once observed, “What the human being is best at doing is interpreting all new information so that their prior conclusions remain intact.… That is a talent everyone seems to have mastered. And how do we guard ourselves against it?” His answer: “A partner who is not subservient and who himself is extremely logical… is probably the best mechanism you can have.” Munger, the ideal foil, has shot down so many investment ideas that Buffett refers to him as “The Abominable No-Man.”</p>
<p class="indent">Munger points out that one essential benefit of having a discussion partner is that it obliges you to organize your thoughts to make a persuasive case. Pabrai recalls introducing Spier to Munger and telling him, “Charlie, this is the person I bounce all my ideas off.” Spier joked that he’s so dumb that Pabrai might as well talk to a monkey. “And Charlie immediately says, ‘The monkey would not work.’ He was very serious. This was like Moses giving the Fourth Commandment. He said, ‘The monkey would not work because Mohnish would <i>know</i> it’s a monkey.’ ”</p>
<p class="indent">Other leading investors have found additional ways to ensure that they remain open to divergent views. Bill Nygren, a renowned fund manager at Harris Associates in Chicago, recalls meeting Michael Steinhardt, a hedge fund billionaire who “would invite two Wall Street analysts into his office: the biggest bull and the biggest bear. And the three of them would argue about an idea over lunch. He always wanted to know what the most bearish people thought of something before he would buy it, or what the most bullish people thought before he would short it.”</p>
<p class="indent">Inspired in part by Steinhardt, Nygren conducts a “devil’s advocate review” before buying any stock. One analyst on his team presents the bullish case. Another is tasked with “putting together the strongest <span aria-label="page 219" id="page_219" role="doc-pagebreak"/>bearish case.… By better understanding what we’re betting against, we’re more likely to make the right decision.”</p>
<p class="indent">Nygren knows that it’s even harder to think objectively about a stock once he owns it. That’s partly because of the endowment effect—a cognitive bias that makes us value what we own more highly than what we don’t, whether it’s a stock or a beer mug. One way that Nygren counteracts this bias is by also performing devil’s advocate reviews for each of his biggest holdings. At least once a year, a team member reassesses the stock in question and “is given the responsibility of arguing why it should be sold.”</p>
<p class="indent">Another psychologically astute strategy is to perform a “premortem” before making any significant investment decision. That’s to say, you project into the future and ask yourself a hypothetical question: “Why did this decision prove to be such a disaster?” The notion of a premortem was devised by an applied psychologist, Gary Klein, to identify problems in advance and reduce the risk of overconfidence. For investors, it’s a valuable safeguard because it forces us to dwell on unfavorable facts and latent threats as a formal step in the decision-making process.</p>
<p class="indent">In 2016, I audited the Advanced Investment Research course at Columbia Business School, which was taught for a decade by Ken Shubin Stein, a friend who was then the chairman of an investment firm called Spencer Capital Holdings. Shubin Stein, who qualified as a doctor before becoming a hedge fund manager, instructed his MBA students to imagine themselves in three years’ time, when an investment of theirs has failed, and to write a newspaper article explaining the cause of death. Another eminent investor told the class that his family office writes a premortem memo as the final precaution before making any investment. The procedure exposes such serious concerns that he rejects one-third of the investments he would otherwise have made.</p>
<p class="indent">Nobody I’ve encountered is more thoughtful than Shubin Stein about the defensive measures we can take to diminish the destructive effects of cognitive biases. It helps that his experience is so diverse. He spent two decades as a fund manager and built a holding company with more than four hundred employees. But he’s also steeped in science, having done research in molecular genetics, trained as a surgeon, and cofounded the International Concussion Society. His interest in <span aria-label="page 220" id="page_220" role="doc-pagebreak"/>the brain is so consuming that he quit the investment business in 2018 and became a neurologist.</p>
<p class="indent">Shubin Stein warns that “you can’t immunize yourself effectively” against cognitive biases, no matter how smart or self-aware you are. The recognition that we are all subject to them is a start, but that knowledge doesn’t protect us against their unconscious influence on our thinking. Still, he offers several practical suggestions that can significantly enhance our ability to make rational decisions, despite the problematic tendencies ingrained in the human brain over millennia.</p>
<p class="indent">For a start, Shubin Stein recommends taking the time to rewrite the list of common cognitive errors that Munger describes in his talk on the psychology of misjudgment. Instead of quoting Munger, it’s best to describe these pitfalls in your own words, so you can internalize his insights and make them your own. It’s also helpful to personalize Munger’s checklist by including investment mistakes you’ve made in the past and emphasizing the tendencies to which you’re especially vulnerable. “You need to learn how your own brain works, where you’re strong, and where your challenges lie,” explains Shubin Stein. For example, he’s highly susceptible to “authority bias,” which has sometimes led him to place too much faith in stocks owned by investment luminaries whom he admires. To help counter this bias, he added two questions to his cognitive checklist: “Have I done the work? And have I independently verified everything?”</p>
<p class="indent">Like Munger, Shubin Stein advocates a “scientific approach” to analyzing investments. <b>That means adopting “a mindset of falsification,” always striving to “disprove” your hypothesis, and seeing “if it stands up to the assault.” One of Shubin Stein’s favorite questions is, “Why might I be wrong?”</b> He also stresses the importance of analyzing “alternative competing hypotheses”—a methodology that he borrowed from Richards Heuer, a CIA veteran who wrote a classic book titled <i>Psychology of Intelligence Analysis</i>. Shubin Stein told his students that they must never forget Heuer’s insight that “a single piece of evidence can support more than one hypothesis.”</p>
<p class="indent">One of Heuer’s enduring contributions to the CIA was to develop a rigorous, eight-step procedure for the “simultaneous evaluation of multiple, competing hypotheses.” Few of us possess the patience to <span aria-label="page 221" id="page_221" role="doc-pagebreak"/>think through problems that thoroughly. But as Heuer suggests, we can’t overcome our “cognitive limitations” unless we have “a systematic analytical process” that enables us to think methodically. <i>Devil’s advocate reviews. Premortems. Conversations with a skeptical discussion partner. A cognitive checklist that reminds us of our biggest biases and our past mistakes.</i> These are all disciplined analytical techniques that can help us systematically to slow down, open our minds, and consider risks that we might otherwise overlook.</p>
<p class="indent">Similarly, Shubin Stein taught his students to perform a “bull/bear analysis” for every company they analyzed—another basic procedure that entails writing two thesis statements (one positive, one negative), each on a single page of its own. The key is to use such techniques routinely, so we consistently challenge our assumptions, contemplate counterarguments, and resist the brain’s tendency to conserve energy by taking shortcuts. <b>This emphasis on adopting systematic analytical procedures is the sixth strategy in our epic quest to be non-idiotic.</b></p>
<p class="indent">Finally, we need a pragmatic way to protect ourselves from our emotions, given how grievously they can compromise our ability to make rational decisions. In his talk, Munger mentions how emotions such as stress, depression, hatred, and envy can cause “dysfunctional” thinking and accentuate our cognitive biases. For example, acute stress and confusion can intensify an investor’s urge to follow the crowd and abandon independent thought, especially when markets are plunging. The desire to seek safety in numbers makes evolutionary sense. But for investors, herd behavior is often disastrous, driving them to buy during bubbles and sell during panics. As Munger once remarked, “Crowd folly, the tendency of humans, under some circumstances, to resemble lemmings, explains much foolish thinking of brilliant men and much foolish behavior.”</p>
<p class="indent">In 2015, the <i>Annual Review of Psychology</i> published a survey of thirty-five years of scientific studies about the effects of emotion on decision-making. The authors write that the “one overarching conclusion” of all that research is that “emotions powerfully, predictably, and pervasively influence decision making.” For example, researchers who studied gambling decisions found that “sadness increased tendencies to favor high-risk, high-reward options, whereas anxiety increased <span aria-label="page 222" id="page_222" role="doc-pagebreak"/>tendencies to favor low-risk, low-reward options.” In other words, our emotional disposition and moods routinely distort what we see and how we relate to risk.</p>
<p class="indent">Based on such research, Shubin Stein developed the precautionary habit of checking whether he’s “in the right psychological and physiological state to make decisions.” This habit is immeasurably valuable not only in markets but in every area of life where our decisions could have calamitous consequences.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>The scientific literature shows that hunger, anger, loneliness, tiredness, pain, and stress are common “preconditions for poor decision making.” So Shubin Stein uses an acronym, HALT-PS, as a reminder to pause when those factors might be impairing his judgment and postpone important decisions until he’s in a state in which his brain is more likely to function well.<sup class="sup"><a href="footnotes.xhtml#footnote-003" id="footnote-003-backlink">IV</a></sup> This is our seventh technique for reducing avoidable stupidity.</b></p>
<p class="indent">During the 2008–09 financial crisis, Shubin Stein suffered an agonizing trial by fire. Many of his fund’s investors bailed out when they should instead have been buying. His business was in jeopardy, and he felt a deep sense of shame as he faced the first grave setback of his career. At the same time, two of his closest friends lost their daughter in a boating accident. It was such a traumatic period that it “catalyzed” him to build a healthier lifestyle that would help him to maintain his emotional equilibrium and think more clearly even under the most stressful conditions.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>“There are four things that we</b> <span class="bolditalic">know</span> <b>improve brain health and brain function,” says Shubin Stein. “Meditation, exercise, sleep, and nutrition.”</b> Determined to use every tool at his disposal, he exercised strenuously, which also helped him to sleep better. He ate more fish, vegetables, and fruit. He renounced his “worst tendencies,” including a habit of handling stress by gorging on vanilla ice cream with mashed-up chocolate chip cookies. And he developed a regular meditation practice—a mission-critical habit for many successful investors.</p>
<p class="indent"><span aria-label="page 223" id="page_223" role="doc-pagebreak"/>These “practices for sustained high performance” have “a compounding effect” when you use them consistently, says Shubin Stein. For example: “The reason you meditate is not because it’s important on a specific day. The regular practice of meditation will help you handle the hard setbacks and will keep you constantly prepared for them.… Having that practice in place prepares you well. It’s a lot like preventative medicine.” This is a critical nuance that I think most of us miss. The optimal time to adopt these healthy habits isn’t when we’re in the throes of chaos, but <i>in advance</i>.</p>
<p class="indent">Once trouble strikes, says Shubin Stein, the key is to recognize that our emotional state may be “setting us up for failure.” When he’s stressed, upset, or overwhelmed, he tries to take a break, makes sure that he’s rested and well fed, and gives himself time to return to a “neutral” state that will “allow for more mindful decision-making.” Simple solutions such as clearing his schedule and sleeping on decisions for a night have also helped considerably. “The more intense things get, the less I do, both personally and professionally,” he says. “I try to slow things down. I try to simplify life.… I look at my calendar and withdraw from a lot of activities to make sure that I’m eating well, meditating, and have structured time to think and reflect.”</p>
<p class="indent">In 2020, Shubin Stein served as a volunteer doctor in an intensive care unit filled with dying COVID-19 patients connected to ventilators. “It literally felt like being in battle,” he says. “We were doing something important, but our lives were at risk and we were putting our families at risk, which felt terrible.” A few days earlier, his wife had given birth to their first child. He moved into a hotel to safeguard them.</p>
<p class="indent">In the midst of this nightmare, Shubin Stein drew on all of the habits that had helped him to handle his emotions during his investment career, including a nutritious diet, exercise, and “small doses of meditation”—which sometimes meant “just breathing for ten seconds” in the bathroom before returning to the ICU. Above all, he tried to remain acutely aware of his “internal state,” so that emotions such as fear, anxiety, sadness, anger, and loneliness wouldn’t undermine his ability to care for his patients and communicate each day with their grief-stricken relatives.</p>
<p class="indent">One “incredibly helpful” tool was his HALT-PS checklist. He used <span aria-label="page 224" id="page_224" role="doc-pagebreak"/>it constantly to gauge his emotional condition and the debilitating effect of the physical pain that he felt while wearing personal protective equipment. Once you recognize “that you’re not at your best,” says Shubin Stein, “you can consciously compensate.” In the hospital, that meant taking additional care to double-check his decisions and pushing himself “to be extra-compassionate with patients.”</p>
<p class="indent">The challenges that he faced were extraordinary, but the overarching lesson applies to all of us. We, too, need the self-awareness and honesty to acknowledge when our emotional state is likely to compromise our judgment and our performance, so we can proceed with heightened caution.</p>
<p class="indent">More broadly, we also need to construct a lifestyle that’s conducive to calm resilience. Munger, for one, has spent inordinate amounts of time engaged in activities that instill a sense of balance and well-being, whether it’s reading books in his library at home, playing bridge with friends, golfing, or fishing. He also keeps an uncluttered schedule that leaves him ample space for contemplation. The details differ, but we all need habits and hobbies that foster equanimity.</p>
<p class="indent">But the truth is, Munger doesn’t struggle like most of us to keep his emotions in check. When I ask him if he agrees with Marks that all of the best investors are unemotional, he replies, “Yes. Absolutely.” Does he ever fret about his investments or feel fearful? “No.” So he doesn’t have to work <i>against</i> those emotions because he doesn’t experience them? “No.”</p>
<p class="indent">In the absence of extreme emotional static, Munger has the freedom to focus with imperturbable detachment on whether the odds of an investment succeeding favor him overwhelmingly. When bank stocks went up in flames during the financial crisis, he concluded that Wells Fargo was so ridiculously cheap that it represented a “once-in-forty-year opportunity.” He bought it on behalf of the Daily Journal at the “bottom tick” in March 2009—a perfect example, he says, of “rationality and good sense.” His lack of emotion is an innate advantage that few investors share. “Warren is wired that way, too,” he says. “We’re quite similar in the way we’re wired.”</p>
<p class="indent">Munger has also learned to control certain toxic emotions that would corrode his enjoyment of life. “Crazy anger. Crazy resentment. Avoid all that stuff,” he tells me. “I don’t let it run. I don’t let it start.” <span aria-label="page 225" id="page_225" role="doc-pagebreak"/>The same goes for envy, which he considers the dumbest of the seven deadly sins because it’s not even fun. He also disdains the tendency to view oneself as a victim, and he has no patience for whining. When I ask if he has a mental process that helps him to defuse self-defeating emotions, he replies, “I <i>know</i> that anger is stupid. I <i>know</i> that resentment is stupid. I <i>know</i> self-pity is stupid. So I don’t do them.… I’m trying not to be stupid every day, all day.”</p>
<h2 class="h2x">Lessons of a Lifetime</h2>
<p class="noindent">At the end of our interview, Munger retrieves his cane and hobbles slowly across the lobby of the Daily Journal’s offices toward a makeshift stage. The audience breaks into sustained applause at the sight of him. He needs help to climb the two stairs onto the stage. Breathing heavily, he takes his seat and peers out with his one good eye at a room overflowing with his admirers. Many are obliged to stand because all of the seats are filled. More people are here than in previous years, he comments wryly, because “they think it’s their last chance.”</p>
<p class="indent">Part guru, part showman, Munger revels in this opportunity to share many lessons from his life. “You’re cult members,” he says, with an air of affectionate amusement. “We’ll stay a long time because some of you have come a long way.” Over the next two hours, he fields more than forty questions, dispensing wisdom and wisecracks about everything from markets to marriage.</p>
<p class="indent">Asked for career advice, he opines: “You have to play in a game where you’ve got some unusual talents. If you’re five foot one, you don’t want to play basketball against some guy who’s eight foot three. It’s just too hard. So you’ve got to figure out a game where you have an advantage, and it has to be something that you’re deeply interested in.”</p>
<p class="indent">Asked about China, he marvels at its economic transformation, but laments that too many Chinese “like to gamble, and they actually believe in luck. Now, that is stupid. What you don’t want to believe in is luck. You want to believe in odds.” Munger has no interest in gambling at casinos or racetracks. “If the odds are against me,” he says, “I just don’t play.”</p>
<p class="indent"><span aria-label="page 226" id="page_226" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Asked about the crash of 1973–74, when his investment partnership lost more than 50 percent, he notes that Berkshire’s stock price has also halved on three occasions: “If you’re going to be in this game for the long pull, which is the way to do it, you better be able to handle a fifty percent decline without fussing too much about it. And so my lesson to all of you is, conduct your life so that you can handle the fifty percent decline with aplomb and grace. Don’t try to avoid it. It will come. In fact, I would say if it doesn’t come, you’re not being aggressive enough.”</p>
<p class="indent">Asked about diversification, he describes it as a fine “rule for those who don’t know anything.” But his preferred strategy is to wait for rare opportunities where the probability of gain vastly outweighs the probability of loss. When they arrive, he grabs them with “gumption.” Munger confides that his family’s ten-figure fortune rides almost entirely on three investments: Berkshire, Costco, and a portfolio of Chinese stocks selected by Li Lu. The chances that any of those three bets will fail is “almost zero,” says Munger. “Am I securely rich? You’re damn right I am.”</p>
<p class="indent">Asked about index funds, he talks about the misery they’ve inflicted on much of the investment profession. The vast majority of active fund managers will fail to beat the index over time, which means they are scraping off fees as a reward for providing no added value. “The honest, sensible people know they’re selling something they can’t quite deliver,” says Munger. “Most people handle that with denial.… I understand that. I mean, I don’t want to think of my own death.”</p>
<p class="indent">The crowd disperses after the shareholder meeting draws to a close. But Munger stays put. A couple of dozen faithful followers gather around him, and he spends two <i>more</i> hours answering questions. For sustenance, he opens a box of See’s peanut brittle. He chomps on it joyously, crumbs flying everywhere, then shares the box with his delighted fans. I stand a few feet from his chair, observing him closely and occasionally asking questions of my own. What impresses me most is not just the range and agility of his mind, but the generosity of his spirit. I find it moving to see the patience, care, and kindness that this ailing master displays to his disciples.</p>
<p class="indent">As Munger looks back on his financial adventures, it becomes clear that what he cherishes most is not the scale of his victory, but the man<span aria-label="page 227" id="page_227" role="doc-pagebreak"/>ner in which he has won it. He recalls a time when he and Buffett gladly rejected “the best deal we ever saw”—the chance to acquire a manufacturer of snuff. There was just one hitch: The company made a fortune hawking an addictive product known to cause cancer. Undeterred, the Pritzker family bought this ugly gem and made a profit of about $3 billion. Still, Munger has no regrets. “We are way better off <i>not</i> making a killing off of a product we knew going into it was a killing product,” he says. “Why should we do that?”</p>
<p class="indent">For Munger, the goal has never been to win at all costs. “Money was very important to him,” says his daughter Molly. “But to win it by cheating or win it and lose the battle for life, that was never what he was about.” In the foreword to <i>Damn Right!</i>, a biography of Munger by Janet Lowe, Buffett writes, “In 41 years, I have never seen Charlie try to take advantage of anyone.… He has knowingly let me and others have the better end of a deal, and he has also always shouldered more than his share of the blame when things go wrong and accepted less than his share of credit when the reverse has been true. He is generous in the deepest sense…”</p>
<p class="indent">Munger embodies an enlightened form of capitalism that is infused with old-fashioned values. For example, he disapproves of mean-spirited tactics such as “brutalizing” suppliers by paying them late. “My theory of life is win-win,” he says. “I want suppliers that trust me and I trust them. And I don’t <i>want</i> to screw the suppliers as hard as I can.” But how does he reconcile his faith in fairness with the reality that many fortunes have been built in a less honorable manner?</p>
<p class="indent">Munger responds by speaking about the multibillionaire media tycoon Sumner Redstone—a famously shrewd and “hard-driven tough tomato” who amassed controlling stakes in Viacom and CBS. “Almost nobody ever liked him, including his wives and his children,” says Munger. “Sumner Redstone and I graduated from Harvard Law School about a year or so apart, and he ends up with more money than I did. So you can say <i>he’s</i> the success. But that’s not the way I look at it. And so I don’t think it’s just a financial game, and I think it’s better to do it the other way.… I use Sumner Redstone all my life as an example of what I don’t want to be.”</p>
<p class="indent">When I ask Munger what we can learn from him and Buffett about <span aria-label="page 228" id="page_228" role="doc-pagebreak"/>how to lead happy lives, he talks about the quality of their relationships and the joy of partnering with decent, trustworthy people: “Warren has been a marvelous partner for me. I’ve been a good partner for him.… If you want to <i>have</i> a good partner, <i>be</i> a good partner. It’s a very simple system, and it’s worked very well.” The same principle applies to marriage, too: “If you want a good spouse, deserve one.”</p>
<p class="indent">Despite his best efforts, Munger has endured his share of suffering. His first son, Teddy, died of leukemia at the age of nine—“a miserable, slow death. And in the end, he kind of knew it was coming, and I’d been lying to him all along.… It was just pure agony.” There was a divorce, too. And the loss of his eye. And the death of his second wife, Nancy, after fifty-two years of marriage. “The idea that life is a series of adversities and each one is an opportunity to behave well instead of badly is a very, very good idea,” says Munger. “I think you take the hardships as they come. You take the blessings as they come. Have fun out of figuring out the puzzles as best you can.”</p>
<p class="indent">It also helps to have a sense of humor. One of the highlights of the Daily Journal meeting comes when Munger recalls his romantic failures as a short, skinny boy at Omaha Central High School eight decades ago. In his freshman year, he invited a “blonde goddess” to a dance. Hoping to impress her, he pretended to be a smoker. “She was wearing a net dress, and I set her on fire,” he says. “But I was quick-witted and I threw Coca-Cola all over her, and in due time the fire was out. And that’s the last I saw of the blonde goddess.”</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, after speaking for five hours straight, Munger is informed that he has another meeting to attend. I help him down from the stage, holding his arm to provide support. As he walks away, I am filled with a sense of awe. Today, I have been in the presence of greatness.</p>
