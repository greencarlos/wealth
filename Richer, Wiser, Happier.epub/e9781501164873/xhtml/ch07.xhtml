<p class="noindent">In 1990, Tom Gayner weighed 190 pounds. Nobody would have mistaken him for an Olympic gold medalist in beach volleyball. Still, he says, his weight was “within the realm of reasonableness.” That year, at age twenty-eight, he took a job running the investment portfolio at the Markel Corporation, an insurance firm based in Richmond, Virginia. Investing is a sedentary sport that largely entails reading, thinking, and playing with numbers. Gayner was built exquisitely for it. Even as a boy of eight or nine, his idea of an enjoyable Friday evening was to sit in front of the TV with his grandmother and watch <i>Wall $treet Week with Louis Rukeyser</i>.</p>
<p class="indent">As he grew older, Gayner’s talent for sitting and thinking had an <span aria-label="page 170" id="page_170" role="doc-pagebreak"/>unintended consequence. His weight gradually drifted above two hundred pounds. Determined to drift no more, he proclaimed to friends and colleagues that he’d lose one pound per year for the next ten years. That may sound absurdly unambitious, but some studies suggest that the average American male gains one to two pounds per year between early adulthood and middle age. Gayner, a master of compounding money, understood how small advantages—or disadvantages—add up over long periods. So he set about changing the unhealthy habits of a lifetime.</p>
<p class="indent">“As a kid, I had the diet of a campground raccoon,” he says. For example, he reckons that he ate about two hundred doughnuts per year. Some dieters would have renounced such sinful pleasures entirely, committing (for a while) to a joyless doughnut-free existence before (almost inevitably) falling off the wagon. Not Gayner. He cheerfully confesses that he might still eat twenty doughnuts per year. Overall, though, he’s done an admirable job of sticking with a healthy diet. I’ve eaten several meals with him over the years, including lunch at an old-fashioned club in New York (where he ordered a Caesar salad with salmon and unsweetened ice tea), two lunches at his office (more salad, more fish), and dinner at his home in the suburbs of Richmond (where he cooked a delicious pesto-flavored salmon with brussels sprouts, accompanied with wine and followed with ice cream). Nutritionally, as in other areas of life, Gayner’s strategy is to be “directionally correct,” not perfect. “In general,” he says, “I’m a satisfier, not an optimizer.”</p>
<p class="indent">He has taken a similar approach to exercise. “I was never very good at athletics,” he says. “The peak of my athletic career was in seventh grade, with church basketball.” He claims to have run less than five miles <i>in total</i> before the age of fifty. Then, while sitting on an airplane, he read a newspaper article with the headline “Do You Hate Running?” “Yeah,” he thought, “I hate running.” But the article laid out a twenty-eight-day program so cunningly innocuous that he decided to try it. In the first week, he was required to run for a maximum of five minutes per day. That grew to ten minutes per day in the second week, fifteen in the third week, and twenty in the fourth week. At that point, he says, “you’ve baby-stepped yourself into it in such a way that you’ve created a habit.” Sure enough, more than five years later, he still runs five times a <span aria-label="page 171" id="page_171" role="doc-pagebreak"/>week. He typically sets off around 5:30 a.m. or 6:00 a.m., while most of us are luxuriating in bed, and jogs about three miles in thirty minutes. “I have deceptive speed,” he says. “I’m even slower than I look.”</p>
<p class="indent">Gayner, who is now the co-CEO of Markel, a financial holding company with insurance and investment operations around the world, may not set any records for the 100-meter dash. But his running habit (topped off with a little yoga and some modest kettlebell lifting) helps him to handle the physical demands and daily stress of a relentless job that involves managing about $21 billion in stocks and bonds, plus a collection of nineteen fully owned companies, not to mention around seventeen thousand employees. “If you’re an executive or a money manager who has these kinds of responsibilities, you’re playing the game twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. There’s no off-season. There are no days off,” he says. “As a consequence, I think it’s very important to be disciplined about paying attention to your wellness, your sleep, your exercise, a little work-life balance, spending time with your wife and kids and your fellow parishioners—all these sorts of things.” Such behavior “may not create the outcome that you want, but it improves your odds.”</p>
<p class="indent">What’s distinctive is the indomitable consistency of his discipline. Most people get fired up for a few days, then flame out. I own a kettlebell and a skipping rope, neither of which I’ve used more than three times. The primary purpose of their existence is to make me feel guilty. Yet Gayner keeps plugging away, never perfect, but always <i>directionally correct</i>. The key, he says, is that he is “radically moderate” about everything he does. “If I make extreme changes, they’re not sustainable. But <i>moderate, incremental</i> changes—they’re sustainable.”</p>
<p class="indent">He’s also careful not to let himself slide too far in the wrong direction. After a brisk walk around a lake near his office, he shows me how his Apple Watch monitors his movements to ensure that he meets his “thirty-minute daily exercise requirement.” Likewise, he checks his weight every day unless he’s traveling, and “if it got away from me, then I’ll work out a little harder or will try to be a little more conscious of what I eat for a while. If you never let it get out of whack, it’s easier to keep things centered. And that, in general, describes much of how I try to get through life.”</p>
<p class="indent"><span aria-label="page 172" id="page_172" role="doc-pagebreak"/>This radically moderate and doggedly persistent strategy demonstrably works.<sup class="sup"><a href="footnotes.xhtml#footnote-012" id="footnote-012-backlink">I</a></sup> When I spent a day and a half interviewing him in 2017, Gayner weighed in at 194 pounds, which is not much more than he weighed twenty-seven years earlier. In terms of weight gain, I’ve outperformed him by a hefty margin, illustrating how minor differences in day-to-day behavior compound over decades.<sup class="sup"><a href="footnotes.xhtml#footnote-011" id="footnote-011-backlink">II</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">All of this points to an important conclusion that applies both to investing and life. <b>Resounding victories tend to be the result of small, incremental advances and improvements sustained over long stretches of time.</b> “If you want the secret to great success, it’s just to make each day a little bit better than the day before,” says Gayner. “There are different ways you can go about doing that, but that’s the story.… Just making progress over and over again is the critical part.”</p>
<h2 class="h2x">“The Aggregation of Marginal Gains”</h2>
<p class="noindent">Gayner has applied the same philosophy to investing. Many investors lurch erratically from one short-term bet or promising strategy to the next, much like yo-yo dieters who bounce between fad diets without entrenching a sustainable solution. Gayner, the patron saint of steady progress, adheres to a stock-picking strategy built on four principles that haven’t changed in thirty years. They point him in the right direction and help him to avoid “being stupid.… They’re like guardrails.”</p>
<p class="indent">First, he seeks “profitable businesses with good returns on capital and not too much leverage.” Second, the management team must have “equal measures of talent and integrity.” Third, the company should <span aria-label="page 173" id="page_173" role="doc-pagebreak"/>have ample opportunity to reinvest its profits at handsome rates of return. Fourth, the stock must be available to him at a “reasonable” price.</p>
<p class="indent">Once Gayner finds a business that passes his four-part test, he looks to invest with “a forever time horizon,” leaving the stock to compound indefinitely while deferring the tax consequences of selling. Berkshire Hathaway was the first stock he bought at Markel back in 1990, and his stake has snowballed to more than $600 million. Buffett made a mistake in 1965 when he acquired control of Berkshire, which was then a failing textile manufacturer destined for extinction. Still, the stock has since soared from about $15 to $330,000 as he’s reinvested the company’s assets in greener pastures. “What you had going for you,” says Gayner, was that the person “making the reinvestment decisions was a genius.” As Gayner sees it, Berkshire demonstrates that the most important of his four criteria is number three, “the reinvestment dynamic.”</p>
<p class="indent">Gayner’s second-largest holding is CarMax, which he’s owned since the late 1990s. Back then, it was a small company with the novel idea of selling used cars at fixed prices, violating the tradition of haggling with and hoodwinking buyers. Gayner, a devout Episcopalian who was raised as a Quaker, recalled that the Macy’s department store was founded in the 1850s by a Quaker who sold each item at a set price, eliminating any suspicion that customers would be duped by sly salesmen. Wouldn’t CarMax enjoy a similar advantage, given its commitment to transparency and fair dealing? What’s more, the stock was cheap and CarMax had boundless opportunities to reinvest its profits by opening new dealerships. Since he first invested, it has expanded from about eight dealerships to two hundred, and the stock has risen more than sixtyfold.</p>
<p class="indent">Gayner’s portfolio is dominated by dependable compounding machines such as Brookfield Asset Management, the Walt Disney Company, Diageo, Visa, and Home Depot—businesses that he expects to prosper for a long time, despite the threat of creative destruction. For example, it reassures him that Diageo owns Johnnie Walker, a two-hundred-year-old brand of Scotch whisky: “That seems to me to be a pretty durable thing. So I just try to find things like that in life.” He’s not looking to trade them, but to sit tight as they grow: “It’s been my <span aria-label="page 174" id="page_174" role="doc-pagebreak"/>experience that the richest people were those who found something good and held on to it. The people who seemed the least happy and the most frenzied and the least successful are those that are always chasing the next hot thing.”</p>
<p class="indent">In all, Gayner owns about one hundred stocks, which may be overly defensive. But two-thirds of his assets are in his top twenty positions, which is moderately aggressive. His attitude toward tech stocks such as Amazon, Alphabet, and Facebook has been similarly measured. He was “very slow” to appreciate their sustainable competitive advantages, but belatedly recognized that they met his four investment criteria. Still, they weren’t cheap, and he couldn’t value them precisely. So he took an incremental approach. He “steadily” accumulated big (not huge) positions, dollar-cost averaging his way in to reduce the risk of overpaying. If he has blundered, it won’t be disastrous.</p>
<p class="indent">This emphasis on disaster avoidance reminds me of a marvelous insight from Jeffrey Gundlach, who oversees about $140 billion as the CEO of DoubleLine Capital. Gundlach, a brash and brilliant billionaire known as the King of Bonds, says he’s wrong about 30 percent of the time. So he asks one critical question before making any investment: “If I assume that I’m wrong on this, what’s the <i>consequence</i> going to be?” He then tries to structure his bet so the outcome won’t be ruinous, whatever happens. <b>“Make your mistakes nonfatal,” Gundlach tells me. “It’s so fundamental to longevity. And ultimately, that’s what success</b> <span class="bolditalic">is</span> <b>in this business: longevity.”</b></p>
<p class="indent">Gayner’s portfolio is built to last. It would have been much more lucrative if he’d loaded up on Amazon, Google, and Facebook. But his investment decisions—much like his approach to food and exercise—are not intended to be optimal. Rather, he’s attempting to be consistently and sustainably sensible. The cumulative effect of operating this way over three decades has been extraordinary because he has harnessed the power of long-term compounding without ever galloping “at such a pace” that he would heighten “the odds of some catastrophic falloff.”</p>
<p class="indent">In the two worst years of his investment career, Gayner’s stock portfolio fell 10.3 percent in 1999 (when tech stocks went berserk and he <span aria-label="page 175" id="page_175" role="doc-pagebreak"/>made the mistake of shorting them) and 34 percent in 2008 (when the credit crisis revealed that some of the businesses he owned were more leveraged than he’d realized). His wife, Susan, who is the CEO of a manufactured-housing business owned by Markel, says those two periods were “dark nights of the soul” for Gayner, filled with “self-doubt and despair.” Gayner says the financial crisis was so stressful that he lost much of his hair. Still, he survived and eventually resumed his steady upward trajectory.</p>
<p class="indent">The results are remarkable. From 1990 through 2019, Gayner’s stock portfolio achieved an average annualized return of 12.5 percent, versus 11.4 percent for the S&amp;P 500. At that rate, $1 million invested in Gayner’s portfolio would have grown to $34.2 million, versus $25.5 million if that money had been invested in the S&amp;P 500. It’s an impressive demonstration of how valuable it is to maintain even a modest edge over a long period.</p>
<p class="indent">“If you can continue to satisfy and be reasonable, there’s all kinds of people that are going to fall away along the path, and it’s amazing how high up in the percentile rankings you’ll become,” says Gayner. “I was never the number one at anything. I’ve always just been steady and competent and able. But as my father said, the best ability is dependability.<sup class="sup"><a href="footnotes.xhtml#footnote-010" id="footnote-010-backlink">III</a></sup> So to do it over and over and over and over again, it keeps you in the game. And it’s amazing how you do sort of become number-oneish over time, just because the competitive field thins out so much.”</p>
<p class="indent">Markel itself has also traveled quite a distance, and in much the same manner. When it went public in 1986, it was an obscure specialty insurer with a market value of about $40 million. The Markel family, which founded the firm in 1930, hired Gayner (who had followed <span aria-label="page 176" id="page_176" role="doc-pagebreak"/>the company for years as an analyst and stockbroker) to help them replicate Berkshire Hathaway’s business model. Gayner took premiums from Markel’s insurance operation and used that “float” to buy stocks and, since 2005, whole companies—much as Buffett invested premiums from <i>his</i> insurance operations. It was a masterful display of cloning, sustained (characteristically) over decades. Still, Gayner dislikes the term <i>cloning</i> as it might imply that he merely copied Buffett, instead of observing what worked and “recombining” it to suit his own circumstances.</p>
<p class="indent">How did it turn out? Gayner pulls out a copy of Markel’s 1987 annual report and shows me that its total assets back then were $57.3 million. By the end of 2019, its total assets had ballooned to <i>$37.4 billion</i>. Markel’s market value has grown to about $14 billion, and the company ranked 335th in the Fortune 500 list for 2020. “That’s a pretty good run from there to here,” says Gayner. “It’s the same path. It’s the same trajectory. It’s the compounding.”</p>
<p class="indent">Markel’s shareholders also have reason to rejoice, including Gayner, who has more than half of his net worth in the stock. At its IPO, Markel traded at $8.33 per share. By the end of 2019, its stock had climbed to $1,143. That’s a 137-fold gain.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>What Gayner’s record shows is that you don’t need to be extreme to achieve exceptional long-term results. On the contrary, he says, “People get themselves into trouble with extremes.”</b> His steadfast pursuit of a radically moderate path would have met with the approval of some of the wisest thinkers in history, such as Confucius, Aristotle, Buddha, and Maimonides.</p>
<p class="indent">Aristotle, the ancient Greek philosopher, argued some twenty-four hundred years ago that excellence and lasting happiness depend on our ability to seek out the “golden mean”—an “intermediate” position that is “equidistant from each of the extremes.” When it comes to physical pleasures such as food, wine, and sex, he taught that we should stake out a middle ground between overindulgence and abstinence. Similarly, in the face of risk, he recommended steering a judicious course between the opposing extremes of timidity and recklessness: “For the man who flies from and fears everything and does not stand his ground against anything becomes a coward, and the <span aria-label="page 177" id="page_177" role="doc-pagebreak"/>man who fears nothing at all but goes to meet every danger becomes rash.”<sup class="sup"><a href="footnotes.xhtml#footnote-009" id="footnote-009-backlink">IV</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Gayner is neither cowardly nor rash. Everything he does seems reasonable and balanced—from the way he eats and exercises to the way he structures his portfolio as a compromise between diversification and concentration. The beauty of his moderate approach to investing and life is not just that it delivers bounteous rewards, but that it’s <i>replicable</i> by regular human beings like you and me. Some of the famous investors I’ve interviewed have so much brainpower that they seem to operate in another realm, including Charlie Munger, Ed Thorp, and Bill Miller. Gayner is highly intelligent. But his real advantage is behavioral, not intellectual. Comparing himself to some of his cleverest peers, he remarks, “I compensate for the lack of intellect with more discipline and steadiness and persistence.”</p>
<p class="indent">That said, it’s easy to underestimate Gayner. Jovial and self-deprecating, he lacks the ego and glamour we often expect from the lords of high finance. He drives a Toyota Prius. (“I like getting fifty miles per gallon because I’m cheap,” he says. “And if we did not need oil, I think the world would be a more peaceful place.”) He lives in a pleasant but modest town house. (“It’s just low maintenance.”) And he describes himself as “very happily married” to his high school sweetheart—a Presbyterian minister’s daughter whom he dated when he was fifteen and married at nineteen. For their first date, his parents drove them to a custard stand in the small town of Salem, New Jersey, where he grew up on a hundred-acre farm.</p>
<p class="indent">In short, there’s nothing flashy or grandiose about Gayner. Yet it would be hard to find a better role model in the investment world. After all, his “satisfying, slow, and steady” method of building wealth relies heavily on common sense and well-chosen habits, not esoteric <span aria-label="page 178" id="page_178" role="doc-pagebreak"/>skills or daredevil risks. When I ask him what regular investors should do to get rich, he offers the least exotic advice imaginable: “Live on less than you make. Invest the difference at a positive rate of return. You cannot fail if you accomplish those two tasks.” He adds, “If you’re living on less than your means, you’re rich right now.”</p>
<p class="indent">Gayner is remorselessly careful about controlling costs. He manages Markel’s investments with razor-thin expenses and maximum tax efficiency—a cost advantage that any of us can emulate by trading infrequently and avoiding financial products with onerous fees. He’s equally frugal in his personal life, a habit that he says was “hardwired” in him during his Quaker childhood. He can’t bear to buy food in airports and can barely bring himself to pay for two restaurant meals a day while on vacation, even though he earns millions of dollars a year in total compensation.</p>
<p class="indent">If frugality is an essential ingredient of his formula for financial success, so, too, is diligence. As an undergraduate at the University of Virginia, he could get away with coasting. Now? Not so much. He typically arrives at the office by 7:15 a.m., packs his mornings with work since that’s when he’s most productive, and allows few distractions. “We’ve structured things to be quiet,” he says. “We’re sitting here in my office. How many times have you heard my phone ring?”</p>
<p class="indent">Attached to the front of his computer screen is a piece of paper bearing a quotation from Michael Jordan: “I failed over and over again in my life, and that is why I succeed.” Gayner likes to remind himself that Jordan didn’t make it onto his varsity basketball team as a sophomore at high school, but then harnessed his “superhuman” work ethic and “sheer willpower” to become one of the greatest players of all time. <b>“You cannot control the outcome,” says Gayner. “You can only control the effort and the dedication and the giving of one hundred percent of yourself to the task at hand. And then whatever happens, happens.”</b></p>
<p class="indent">When I interviewed him again in 2020, the United States was in the throes of riots and a pandemic. But Gayner remained as focused as ever on controlling his own effort, sticking to his investment process, and setting an example for his employees. “Keep putting one foot in front of the other,” he told me. “That’s what has guided me my whole life. So why should that be different now?”</p>
<p class="indent"><span aria-label="page 179" id="page_179" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Another feature of Gayner’s incremental self-improvement strategy is his deep commitment to “continuous” learning. He reads voraciously—everything from scientific books on habit formation to biographies to novels by his favorite author, Mark Twain. But he also views himself as “a node in a neural network,” interconnected with many smart people who can assist in his constant quest to expand his knowledge and improve his skills.</p>
<p class="indent">Chuck Akre, a renowned money manager whom we’ll soon meet again, helped him to refine his understanding of reinvestment as the most powerful driver of business success. Josh Tarasoff, a gifted hedge fund manager, helped him to figure out why he should own Amazon. Gayner also served for years alongside Buffett on the board of the Washington Post Company. One indelible lesson was that “persistence and endurance” are essential components of Buffett’s edge: “The energy and stamina that he has is absolutely unbelievable.… In the morning, he’s ready to go, and he’s the Energizer Bunny who just keeps going and going and going. That’s an athletic feat.”</p>
<p class="indent">It’s no accident that Gayner enjoys the trust of many leading investors. “One of the advantages I have is that I’m a nice guy,” he says. “I try to help people. I try to do the right thing. As a consequence, what I’ve found is that I have this wonderful network of friends, colleagues, and associates who are rooting <i>for</i> me, rather than <i>against</i> me. And they help you. They just help you.” We sometimes assume that you have to be ruthless to elbow your way to the top. But Gayner illustrates the subtler benefits of consistently looking to be kind and decent. I’ve come to think of this underappreciated edge as the Mensch Effect. Guy Spier, who runs the Aquamarine Fund, invests so much of his energy in helping others that he is similarly surrounded by people who wish to help him. Spier describes this phenomenon as “the compounding of goodwill.”</p>
<p class="indent">If your goal is <i>sustainable</i> success, Gayner is convinced that it works better to behave admirably, not least because more people want to do business with you if you’re trustworthy. “Sometimes people build great careers and enjoy great successes for a period of time through bluster and bullying and intimidation and slipperiness,” he says. “But that always comes unraveled. Always. Sometimes it takes a while, but it does. The people you find that just keep being successful year after <span aria-label="page 180" id="page_180" role="doc-pagebreak"/>year after year after year, I think you find those are people of deep integrity.”</p>
<p class="indent">When I try to identify the many reasons why Gayner has achieved so much, I’m reminded of a concept that Nick Sleep mentioned to me: “the aggregation of marginal gains.” The phrase was coined by a legendary performance coach, Sir David Brailsford, who turned the British cycling team into an unstoppable force at the Beijing and London Olympics. Those triumphs stemmed not from one major innovation, but <i>a multitude of minor improvements</i>, which combined to create a crushing advantage. For example, Brailsford’s cyclists raced on wheels rubbed with alcohol to enhance their grip. They wore electrically heated overshorts to maintain the right temperature for their muscles. They studied how surgeons wash their hands to reduce the risk of illness. They even brought their own pillows on trips so they were more likely to sleep well.</p>
<p class="indent">Brailsford, who has an MBA, was inspired by the Japanese principle of <i>kaizen</i> (continuous improvement), which had played a starring role in vaulting Toyota to greatness. Speaking with Eben Harrell at the <i>Harvard Business Review</i>, Brailsford explained, “It struck me that we should think small, not big, and adopt a philosophy of continuous improvement through the aggregation of marginal gains. Forget about perfection; focus on progression, and compound the improvements.”</p>
<p class="indent">Sleep, who is an avid cyclist, says the best businesses share this obsession with securing even the most marginal gains. He recalls how Lord Harris, the founder of Carpetright, insisted on reusing old price tags, writing on both sides to save a penny here, a penny there. “It’s not one secret sauce,” says Sleep. “You just have to care about all the little things and add them all together.”</p>
<p class="indent">If you want to understand Gayner’s success, then look no further. Nobody cares more about all the little things. Individually, his day-to-day habits seem inconsequential—the equivalent of cyclists traveling with their favorite pillows. <i>He gets up early and arrives at the office early. He jogs and does yoga. He eats heaps of salad and a dearth of doughnuts. He works in a quiet office where he can focus. He consistently applies four time-tested principles as a filter for every investment idea. He invests in a tax-efficient manner. He keeps his investment expenses as low as possible.</i> <span aria-label="page 181" id="page_181" role="doc-pagebreak"/><i>He lives way below his means. He reads insatiably. He studies and intelligently clones other sophisticated investors. He prays, goes to church, and draws emotional strength from his faith in a higher power. He behaves in ways that inspire trust and goodwill.</i></p>
<p class="indent"><b>None of these practices is earth-shattering in isolation. But remember: it’s the</b> <span class="bolditalic">aggregation</span> <b>of marginal gains that’s so powerful. Moreover, the modest benefits generated by smart habits continue to compound over many years.</b> In the short run, all those tiny, incremental advances seem insignificant. But time is the enemy of bad habits and the friend of good habits. When you pound away year after year, decade after decade, the cumulative effect is stunning. Indeed, what sets Gayner apart is one indispensable trait: he is the king of constancy.</p>
<p class="indent">The good news, then, is that we don’t need a secret sauce or a stratospheric IQ. <b>What we need is a selection of sensible habits that are directionally correct and sustainable—habits that give us a marginal advantage that will compound over time.</b> Gayner has set us on the right track. Now let’s see what other high-performance habits the best investors adopt to give themselves that persistent edge.</p>
<h2 class="h2x">Bring the Heat</h2>
<p class="noindent">In 2000, I interviewed Jeff Vinik, a secretive investment superstar who, at thirty-three, had become the manager of the world’s biggest and most famous mutual fund: Fidelity’s Magellan Fund. Will Danoff, who succeeded him as the manager of Fidelity’s Contrafund, says Vinik was “the best fund manager” of their generation at Fidelity—“an investing prodigy.”</p>
<p class="indent">Vinik beat the S&amp;P 500 during his four years at Magellan; left Fidelity on a sour note after an ill-timed bet on bonds; then launched a gunslinging hedge fund whose results were a wonder to behold. When we spoke, his company, Vinik Asset Management, was about to return billions to his investors, so he could manage his own riches and spend more time with his family. By then, he’d spent a total of twelve years as a fund manager and had averaged a stunning 32 percent a year.</p>
<p class="indent">When I asked Vinik why he’d been so successful, he offered two <span aria-label="page 182" id="page_182" role="doc-pagebreak"/>explanations. First, he said, “I’ve really used the same consistent approach to investing throughout my career, which is focusing on individual companies with good earnings outlooks that are selling at very reasonable valuations.” For example, he’d recently made a fortune on “little, mundane restaurant stocks that will grow earnings twenty percent [a year] but are selling at twelve times earnings. That’s the real show, and that’s the way to make money.” In retrospect, this seems to me a perfect example of Joel Greenblatt’s notion of reducing the complexity of investing to its essence and applying the most fundamental principles over and over again.</p>
<p class="indent">Second, said Vinik, “There’s another constant through the twelve years, and that’s very, very hard work. The more companies you can analyze, the more cash-flow statements you can go through—and go through every line of—the more good ideas you’re going to find and the better the performance is going to be. There’s no substitute for hard work.”</p>
<p class="indent">What was his schedule like? “I’m usually in the office at 6:45 in the morning,” Vinik told me. “I go home at approximately 5:00 p.m., so I can spend a lot of time with my family. Usually, after my children go to bed, I’ll do two to three hours of reading at night.” He waded through heaps of corporate filings and industry publications and tried to read “all the research that Wall Street puts out.” It helped that he had a phenomenal memory: “The way I operate is just to keep track in my head of what’s going on in literally thousands of companies.” That way, he was poised to detect subtle shifts that others would overlook—for example, the turning point when profits began to accelerate at a scorned cyclical business whose prospects were about to improve.</p>
<p class="indent">Danoff’s investment style is different, with more emphasis on holding stocks for the long run. But his work ethic is no less intense. “Money management is all about turning over more rocks, talking to more analysts, looking at more annual reports. And the more you do, the better you’re going to do,” he says. “It’s crazy competitive.” Danoff has managed the Contrafund since 1990. Still, through some peculiar quirk in his wiring, his hunger for beating the market and adding value for his shareholders has never dwindled. “Other fund managers don’t give a shit, quite frankly,” he says. Many are “in it for the fees” or “the glory.… I <i>care</i> more.”</p>
<p class="indent"><span aria-label="page 183" id="page_183" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Danoff reads me a letter he received in 1993 from a couple who had invested in his fund to save for their one-year-old son’s college education: “We have enclosed his pictures so you can get a sense that there are real people out here trusting you with their hard-earned money.” For Danoff, that responsibility—combined with “guilt,” “fear,” and the desire to “set a good example”—is a powerful motivator. He declares, “I have to bring the heat every day.”<sup class="sup"><a href="footnotes.xhtml#footnote-008" id="footnote-008-backlink">V</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Whatever their motivation, I think of the best investors as mental athletes. They strive constantly for an intellectual advantage—<i>more</i> information, <i>better</i> information, <i>faster</i> information, or simply a more nuanced interpretation of information that’s already out there for everyone to see. All that hard-earned knowledge compounds over time and pays off in unpredictable ways.</p>
<p class="indent">Danoff, who meets with the management of hundreds of companies each year, shows me his notes from an April 2004 meeting with a “dying” dot-com business, Ask Jeeves. Its executives revealed that they were getting crushed by an unbeatable upstart: Google. That was the day, says Danoff, “when I first realized that Google is a special company.” Primed with that insight, he met with Google’s cofounder Sergey Brin and CEO, Eric Schmidt, in August 2004 and began to grasp the enormity of its potential. Google’s revenues were doubling every few months, says Danoff, and it boasted 25 percent operating margins, loads of cash, and no debt: “Its financial performance was extraordinary, particularly when compared with the many unprofitable unicorns of today.” Most fund managers steered clear when Google went public later that month. But Danoff’s fund became one of its largest investors. Sixteen years later, the company (now renamed Alphabet) is still one of his biggest and most profitable investments.</p>
<p class="indent">As a marquee player at a firm with $7.3 trillion in customer assets, Danoff can gain access to almost anyone. But what distinguishes him is his determination to leverage that advantage by driving himself inces<span aria-label="page 184" id="page_184" role="doc-pagebreak"/>santly to keep turning over those rocks. On a research trip to Palo Alto in 2010, it bothered him to discover a gap in his packed schedule. “Wednesday after four thirty p.m., why aren’t we seeing anybody?” he asked his colleagues. “Maybe we should see Tesla.” Danoff visited the money-losing carmaker as “an afterthought,” arriving late on a December afternoon when it was turning dark outside. Within minutes, Tesla’s charismatic founder, Elon Musk, made an unscheduled appearance and described his vision of “making fabulous cars that America is going to be proud of again.” Danoff was so impressed that he made an early—and extremely lucrative—investment, which he continues to own a decade after that auspicious trip.</p>
<p class="indent">It’s no coincidence that Vinik and Danoff both started out as protégés of Peter Lynch, who had run the Magellan Fund for thirteen years with blazing intensity. When I interviewed Lynch two decades ago, he explained the simple logic that had driven him to study so many stocks each day. “I always thought that if you looked at ten ideas in a day, you might find one good one,” he told me. “If you looked at twenty, you might find two.” Recalling one of his best investments, Lynch added, “If a hundred people had visited Chrysler in 1982 with an open mind, ninety-nine would have bought it.”</p>
<p class="indent">Once again, it’s all about the cumulative effect of many minuscule advantages, which add up miraculously over years: the <i>one extra company</i> that Lynch bothered to visit; the <i>one empty time slot</i> that Danoff insisted on filling; the <i>two or three extra hours</i> of reading that Vinik pushed himself to complete after his kids went to bed. The best predictor of success is often nothing more mysterious than the unflagging fervency of a person’s desire.</p>
<p class="indent">Early in his career, Bill Miller asked Lynch for advice. Lynch told him that the investment business is so rewarding financially and intellectually that it attracts an overabundance of intelligent people. “The only way you can beat them is to outwork them,” said Lynch, “because nobody is just so much smarter than the next person.” Lynch told Miller that he stayed ahead of the pack by reading investment research while he carpooled to the office at 6:30 a.m., working after dinner and on weekends, and taking no vacations for years. When Miller asked if it was possible to slow down as you got older, Lynch replied, “No. In this <span aria-label="page 185" id="page_185" role="doc-pagebreak"/>business, there are only two gears: overdrive and stop.” Miller agrees: “That’s basically right. You <i>have</i> to be focused.”</p>
<p class="indent">In 2014, when Marty Whitman was ninety, I asked him why he’d performed so badly during and after the 2008 crash—a rare failure for one of the giants of value investing. “As I got older and richer, I got lazier,” he told me. “I really knew better in 2007 and didn’t act on it. I should have sold all my housing-related stocks.… It doesn’t reflect on the investment techniques. You’ve got to be diligent and careful, and in 2008, I wasn’t.”</p>
<p class="indent">I admired Whitman’s candor, but his confession troubled me. I’d invested with him for many years and been happy with the results, which led me to trust his firm with a major portion of my mother’s savings. It hadn’t occurred to me that he would become complacent. Looking back on his dismal handling of the financial crisis, Whitman remarked, “It’s intellectually dissatisfying, but it doesn’t make that much difference.… What’s the difference if my kids end up with ten million dollars less and charities end up with ten million or twenty million dollars less?” I didn’t have the heart to tell him that his lack of care and diligence would make a profound difference to my mother.</p>
<h2 class="h2x">“Very Few People Could Be Married to Me”</h2>
<p class="noindent">To surpass so many smart competitors, it’s not enough merely to outwork them. You also have to <i>outthink</i> them. Even the most experienced investors must engage in a ceaseless process of continuing education because the world changes so drastically that aspects of their knowledge become outdated. As Munger often remarks, one of Buffett’s most valuable traits is that, even in old age, he remains “a continuous learning machine.” On a typical day, Buffett might read for five or six hours, frequently isolating himself in his office with the door shut.</p>
<p class="indent">“Buffett is a perfect example of the degree to which you can improve yourself over the years,” says Paul Lountzis, the president of Lountzis Asset Management. Lountzis, who has attended Berkshire’s annual meeting for three decades, is awed by Buffett’s ability to keep evolving. He started out by investing in cheap stocks, then embraced better businesses, then <span aria-label="page 186" id="page_186" role="doc-pagebreak"/>bought whole companies, then ventured into foreign markets such as China and Israel, then invested in two industries he’d famously avoided: railroads and technology. That evolution enabled Buffett to make the most lucrative stock pick of his career in his late eighties—an investment in Apple Inc. that has so far earned a profit of more than $80 billion. “He’s kept true to his discipline and principles, but he’s adapted them to the particular economic and investing environment at the time,” says Lountzis. “It’s unbelievable. Very few people can do that.”</p>
<p class="indent">Lountzis, too, is a consummate practitioner of continuous learning, which has helped him to haul himself out of meager circumstances and become a well-regarded money manager. Born in 1960, he grew up in a Greek immigrant family in Pennsylvania, one of five children of a bartender and a sewing-machine operator. “My dad would leave the tips on the kitchen table, and that’s what my mom used to go grocery shopping,” he says. “My parents just sacrificed.… My mom would wear shoes from friends and not buy shoes for herself.” Early in their marriage, when they already had three kids, their life savings amounted to $30.</p>
<p class="indent">When Lountzis was eight, he started earning money by washing dishes. He later worked as a cleaner at McDonald’s and paid his way through Albright College by working full-time in a hospital every weekend and vacation. It took him eight years to graduate.</p>
<p class="indent">On the side, he studied investing. “I immersed myself fanatically,” he says. At thirteen, he read about Buffett. At fourteen, he was mesmerized by Ben Graham’s <i>The Intelligent Investor</i>. He then became captivated by Philip Fisher’s 1958 classic, <i>Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits</i>, which introduced him to the practice of “scuttlebutt” research as a means of gaining an informational advantage. “Those two books really created the foundation,” says Lountzis. “I’ve read them both fifty or sixty times.”</p>
<p class="indent">Lountzis is a warm and exuberant man who speaks effusively of his four adult children and his wife, Kelly, who has stayed by his side for almost forty years. But his life is built almost entirely around his compulsive craving for any knowledge that could make him a better investor. “I try to read four, five, six, seven hours a day, seven days a week,” he says. “I have no hobbies. I have never golfed in my life.… It’s just my personality—always trying to get smarter, to learn.”</p>
<p class="indent"><span aria-label="page 187" id="page_187" role="doc-pagebreak"/>He regards social functions as a bothersome distraction: “I love people. But if I’m not learning and growing and being stimulated intellectually, I’d rather be elsewhere.” Part of what he cherishes about his wife is that “she places no demands on me, and I can’t tell you how important that is.… She understands me and lets me be me. Very few people could be married to me.” Lountzis makes no apologies for his extremism: “You need a maniacal focus to really be great at anything. Anyone who tells you that you can have everything all at once, you can’t. I mean, you don’t become Roger Federer by not playing tennis. It <i>has</i> to be consuming.”</p>
<p class="indent">Lountzis is a ravenous consumer of insights from the titans of business and investing. He adores books about entrepreneurs such as Nike’s cofounder Phil Knight: “I could read everything ever written about him. That fascinates me.” He also has a server on which he’s stockpiled thousands of videos featuring financial wizards who help him to think better about investing, markets, and where the world is headed: hedge fund managers such as Mohnish Pabrai and Stanley Druckenmiller; venture capitalists such as Michael Moritz and Jim Goetz; and private equity visionaries such as Leon Black and Stephen Schwarzman. Lountzis says he has at least five hundred videos of Buffett, along with any recording he can find of Munger’s infrequent public appearances. And then there are his transcripts of dozens of their annual meetings. Buffett and Munger “are not just really smart,” he says. “They’re geniuses.”</p>
<p class="indent">Most days, Lountzis watches a video on his iPhone while riding a Peloton bike at his gym. Most nights, he lies in bed and watches a video on his iPad, often lulled to sleep by the sweet sounds of investment wisdom. As he listens, he keeps pondering the same underlying questions: “What am I missing? Who’s doing something that no one else is doing? How can I get better?” His aim is never to replicate other investors’ behavior. “You can’t mimic them because you’re not them,” he says. “Learn it and adapt it and modify it into your own process.”</p>
<p class="indent">There is breadth to his studies. But what makes Lountzis such a powerful learning machine is his habit of obsessive repetition. For example, he estimates that he’s watched Buffett’s 1998 lecture at the University of Florida fifteen times and has read the transcript at least five times. <span aria-label="page 188" id="page_188" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Likewise, he’s studied Berkshire’s 1993 annual report with such devotion that he can recite, in order, the five main factors that Buffett said he considers when evaluating the riskiness of any stock. It’s this same habit of repetition that has kept Lountzis trekking to Omaha for Berkshire’s annual meeting for nearly thirty years and has led him to read the same books dozens of times. The benefit of so much repetition, he says, is that many “foundational” teachings are “etched in my brain”—not unlike the effect of repeating the same prayers or affirmations every day.</p>
<p class="indent">I suspect that the value of repetition is vastly underrated and that most of us would do well to find one or two books that we read so often that they become part of us. I dip into the <i>Zohar</i> almost every day, and there are other books that I return to again and again, including <i>Meditations</i> by Marcus Aurelius, <i>The Wisdom of Truth</i> by Rav Yehuda Ashlag, and <i>The Book of Joy</i> by the Dalai Lama and Archbishop Desmond Tutu.</p>
<p class="indent">Having ingrained many timeless investment principles so they are part of his essence, Lountzis follows his own bespoke process to assemble a portfolio of around fifteen intensively researched stocks.<sup class="sup"><a href="footnotes.xhtml#footnote-007" id="footnote-007-backlink">VI</a></sup> He focuses on outstanding businesses with leaders who are “creative, adaptable, visionary” and have “enormous courage.” Such qualities are more important than ever in an era of unprecedented disruption, which threatens even the most dominant businesses. “The problem,” says Lountzis, is that <i>qualitative</i> factors such as adaptability or courage “are not measurable” in financial statements, which offer a <i>quantitative</i> record of the past.</p>
<p class="indent">His solution is to operate more like an investigative reporter than an accountant. “Businesses are changing very rapidly, and many of them are becoming obsolete, so you have to see around corners and get some insight beyond the numbers,” says Lountzis. “You’ve got to go out in the field and talk to competitors, customers, former employees, and then create a mosaic that you can dovetail on top of the numbers.” With that in mind, he frequently conducts in-person interviews with <span aria-label="page 189" id="page_189" role="doc-pagebreak"/>experts, such as retired CEOs, who can provide “unique, differential insights.”</p>
<p class="indent">Laura Geritz is an equally formidable learning machine. But she has built a different type of informational advantage. While Lountzis invests primarily in the United States, Geritz is one of America’s foremost investors in foreign markets. In a typical year, she spends six to nine months roaming around the world in search of the best investments. At the age of forty-eight, she’s already traveled to seventy-five countries. Geritz, who is the CEO and chief investment officer of Rondure Global Advisors in Salt Lake City, Utah, feels a profound sense of duty to shareholders in her two mutual funds. But she’s not that interested in piling up money for herself. She remarks, “I have enough.” Above all, she’s an intellectual adventurer, propelled by “the passion to learn.”</p>
<p class="indent">In an industry overrun by alpha males, many molded by the same elite business schools, Geritz fits none of the stereotypes of her profession. She’s a true original, who likens her “nonlinear” investment approach to the unconstrained poetic rhythms of free verse. From the start, she was never a conventional candidate for a career in fund management. Many of her relatives were farmers and factory workers. Her father took a position as a literature professor at a small college and moved the family to what Geritz describes as “a tiny little town in western Kansas, straight out of the opening paragraph of <i>In Cold Blood</i>.” In case you don’t remember the opening paragraph of Truman Capote’s nonfiction novel about a quadruple murder, it begins like this: “The village of Holcomb stands on the high wheat plains of western Kansas, a lonesome area that other Kansans call ‘out there.’ ” Geritz, a diminutive Midwesterner with a mild and unassuming manner, may not seem like a warrior. But making the journey from “out there” to where she is today required astonishing drive and determination.</p>
<p class="indent">Geritz studied political science and history at the University of Kansas, but she also delighted in reading the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> every day. By nineteen, she’d saved enough to invest for the first time, buying shares in a fund run by Marty Whitman. She fantasized about investing professionally, but figured that she could never break into the business unless she developed a skill that set her apart. So she did a master’s <span aria-label="page 190" id="page_190" role="doc-pagebreak"/>degree in East Asian languages and culture, lived in Japan for a year, and became fluent in Japanese. As a result, she landed a job as a bilingual client representative at American Century Investments. A couple of years later, she won a spot as an analyst on the firm’s fund management team—a position that could attract as many as twelve thousand applicants. She subsequently spent a decade at Wasatch Advisors, earning renown as a market-beating fund manager who specialized in emerging and frontier markets. She quit to create her own firm in 2016 and hired three analysts who work alongside her in one “very noisy” room.</p>
<p class="indent">When we first spoke in 2017, Geritz’s funds were only two weeks old. But she’d already made research trips to Russia, Turkey, Japan, and South Korea. Twice a year, she screens about sixty-nine thousand stocks, which helps her to identify unloved markets that she can visit in her global scavenger hunt for great companies at good prices or good companies at great prices. “I like to go where others aren’t going,” she says. “If you’re daring to be different, to be great, you have to go against the grain.” The market that excited her most was Turkey, where she’d just met with about thirty companies. But it wasn’t hard to see why so few investors shared her excitement.</p>
<p class="indent">Turkey’s autocratic president, who had celebrated his own magnificence by building himself a palace with more than eleven hundred rooms, had recently survived an attempted military coup. He lashed back by declaring a state of emergency; jailing thousands of soldiers, police, and judges; closing media outlets; and denouncing his political opponents as terrorists. The nation’s reputation was further scarred by a series of suicide bombings, including one at Istanbul’s main airport. Tourism collapsed. The currency plunged. Inflation and debt soared. Foreign investors fled.</p>
<p class="indent">But Geritz had visited Turkey many times before, allowing her a more nuanced perspective. A few years earlier, when optimism about the country’s economic future had been in full bloom, she’d attended an investment conference in Istanbul. Back then, the hotel hosting the event had wanted $1,200 a night for a room, and she’d refused to stay there. “This time, I paid seventy dollars a night for a hotel,” says Geritz. “To me, that’s pessimism to an extreme.” The day-to-day reality also seemed nowhere near as frightening as the foreign news coverage sug<span aria-label="page 191" id="page_191" role="doc-pagebreak"/>gested: “On the ground, I don’t feel any reason to be afraid. It’s one of the friendliest countries in the world.”</p>
<p class="indent">For Geritz, that gap between reality and perception offered an ideal opportunity to invest for the long haul in three of Turkey’s best businesses: its largest grocery chain, its leading defense company, and its dominant maker of candy. All three had sustainable competitive advantages, reliable cash flows, high returns on invested capital, and (most critical) strong balance sheets. Plus, they were so cheap that she was unlikely to suffer any permanent loss of capital. Given the dangers in developing markets, this unwavering emphasis on risk mitigation is crucial. Indeed, most of the companies Geritz owns have net cash, enabling them to endure terrible times when the supply of capital dries up and weak businesses wither. “I’m really investing in survivors,” she says. “I buy great companies, but I like to buy them in countries that have been hit.”</p>
<p class="indent">Geritz’s willingness to travel extensively gives her a <i>cumulative advantage</i> over more parochial investors. “The more you go out into the world, the more you see the patterns,” she says, including cycles of boom and bust that recur in different countries as credit expands or contracts and optimism rises or falls. This pattern recognition helps in “avoiding the massive blowups you can get in emerging and frontier markets.” For example, she sold out of Brazil during a period of euphoria when foreign capital had flooded in, the government had overspent, and prices had gone crazy. The symptoms of excess looked ominously familiar. “The hotels were a thousand dollars a night, easily,” she recalls. “I had spent, I think, thirty-five dollars on a piece of pizza in the airport.”</p>
<p class="indent">She saw similar warning signs in Nigeria when foreigners piled in, convinced that it was “the best investment destination in Africa.” Her wary verdict: “I’ve seen that movie before. I’ve seen it in China when valuations go high and everyone loves the market. I’ve seen it in Brazil.”</p>
<p class="indent">Before each trip, Geritz creates a study program designed to enrich her understanding of the place she’s visiting. “I try to read at least three books for every country I go to,” she says. Typically, one book is about the economics or politics of the country or region; one is a work of literature; and one is a lighter piece of pop culture, such as a mystery or <span aria-label="page 192" id="page_192" role="doc-pagebreak"/>crime novel. “If we’re going for a research trip to Uganda, I probably carry a tiny suitcase full of clothes and a giant backpack full of twenty books,” she says. “It’s a big joke.” She also carries a Kindle, “but I’ve had it go down in a couple of countries, and I can’t live without books.”</p>
<p class="indent">Geritz and her team at Rondure meet every couple of weeks to discuss a book that they’ve been reading as a group: “The last book we read was <i>Investing the Templeton Way</i>, which I’ve read many times. But it might also be something like <i>Grit</i> or <i>The Creative Brain</i>.” For the past thirteen years, she has also chosen one major subject (sometimes two) that she studies in depth throughout the year. These topics, which she selects with joyous anticipation, have included Africa, the Middle East, physics, oil, and “the literature and history of Russia.” In 2019, we chatted over a sushi lunch, and I asked Geritz about her latest topic. Her reply: “Oh, it’s a quirky one! I’m reading all about explorers, starting from the Vikings.”</p>
<p class="indent">Geritz, who reads two or three books a week, seldom bothers with newspapers and ignores the minute-by-minute news on her Bloomberg terminal: “I’d rather read the <i>Rise of the Robots</i> and think about what the world might look like ten years from now than think about what the world looked like ten minutes ago.” It’s an unusually cerebral approach to investing, based on her belief that reading deeply and traveling widely will give her a more expansive perspective that is a significant, yet intangible, edge. “There’s a limit to just sitting in an office and perusing financials day in and day out,” she says. “I don’t think our job is a linear one.”</p>
<p class="indent">Geritz has even tried to institutionalize her freewheeling mindset by designating Fridays as “our creative day,” which her colleagues can spend as they wish. She often uses it to sit beside a stream in Salt Lake City, where she reads in peace or writes in journals as a way of synthesizing ideas from her travels. She finds it useful to be based in Utah: “Being here, off the beaten path, allows you to think.” During the coronavirus pandemic, an earthquake and several construction projects made her apartment unsuitable for “deep thinking.” So she rented “a quiet house with a stream” in a remote part of Idaho and quarantined herself contentedly with forty-five books.</p>
<p class="indent">But Geritz also wanders farther afield to other places that are condu<span aria-label="page 193" id="page_193" role="doc-pagebreak"/>cive to contemplation. Among them, she visits an island off the Australian coast with only eight houses: “You take a boat with your groceries and they leave you on the island. Sometimes you have cell phone communication and sometimes you don’t. You don’t have internet. You have some music and you have a beautiful view of the water and you have your books.”</p>
<p class="indent">Intermittently, Geritz plants herself in a foreign location for weeks at a time, so she can immerse herself more fully in the culture, studying how the locals live, spend, and consume. She rents a cheap vacation property near the center of the market she wants to learn about and uses it as her regional base, partly “because the wear and tear of flying back and forth gets really hard,” since she travels in economy class. Over the years, she has stationed herself in countries as diverse as Tanzania, Kenya, England, France, Holland, Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Thailand, Singapore, and Japan.</p>
<p class="indent">Several years ago, when Japanese property prices were depressed, she grabbed the chance to buy an apartment in the heart of Kyoto, the ancient imperial capital, which gives her a base from which to visit companies across Asia. It’s a simple place with a bed, a sofa, a table, and a couple of chairs. It used to be a restaurant specializing in blowfish—a deadly delicacy unless the poison is skillfully extracted. Her yard is dominated by a big rock that she can’t move because the locals believe it was placed there to honor “the snake god.” Geritz spends at least one month a year in Kyoto. When I ask if she regards America or Japan as her home, she replies, “Honestly, Japan.”</p>
<p class="indent">Most of us yearn to live in a place where we feel a sense of belonging and inclusion. But her natural state is to be “a complete and total outsider.” For investors, she says, “one of the critical components is just to be able to observe, and that’s all you can really do in Japan: be an observer. Because you’ll never get embedded enough in society to be fully accepted as part of it.”</p>
<p class="indent">To invest successfully in a country as distinctive as Japan, she must set aside her preconceptions and observe the culture on its own terms. For example, American companies typically put their shareholders’ interests first. But Geritz, whose Rondure Overseas Fund has one-third of its assets in Japan, says the priority for Japanese companies is to <span aria-label="page 194" id="page_194" role="doc-pagebreak"/>serve their customers, followed by their employees, business partners, and society at large: “And then I think the shareholder comes last.”</p>
<p class="indent">Activist investors from the West often try in vain to persuade Japanese CEOs to boost profits in the short term by deploying cash more productively or taking on more debt. But Geritz says the Japanese care more about building companies that survive—sometimes for centuries—despite such threats as earthquakes, tsunamis, wars, and epidemics. “It’s not an instant-gratification culture,” she says. Given her inclination to build wealth sustainably, their conservatism suits her.</p>
<p class="indent">Geritz’s globe-trotting career has satisfied her limitless curiosity. But it comes at a cost. “You can’t stop,” she says. “If I’m pausing for any length of time, I lose my edge.… You owe it to your investors not to pause because it’s their future.” Even simple pastimes that “most normal people” enjoy “like going to the ski slopes or hanging out with friends” would be “very hard for me,” she says, “because all I want to think about is stocks and countries.”</p>
<p class="indent">What about family? “I don’t have kids, and I’m really fortunate because I have a husband who I love and who knows that this is what I do [and] knows what it takes. So he has always been incredibly supportive.” Her husband, Robb, an American whom she met in high school, is in international sales at a manufacturer of sporting goods. His work has given him the flexibility to tag along on many of her research trips. But their jobs require them to spend long periods apart. He mostly lives in their home in Kyoto, while she mostly lives in their home in Utah.</p>
<p class="indent">Geritz knew from the start that a high-pressure investment career would demand extreme focus. So she postponed any thought of raising children: “Part of it was the challenges and rigors of being a female in the business early on, recognizing that in order to keep up with the guys in the industry, that might not be the best thing to do.” In those days, there were hardly any female role models at American Century. But Geritz remembers one woman in her office who couldn’t work beyond 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. because she had a child: “She was told that they would never promote her to a higher level because the minimum hours they expected were a lot longer.… You didn’t have to be told. You just emulated who was successful, and the people who were <span aria-label="page 195" id="page_195" role="doc-pagebreak"/>successful were those who stayed in the office from six a.m. to ten p.m. and then were there Saturday and Sunday.”</p>
<p class="indent">Later in her career, Geritz felt ready to have a child, but by then her husband was more hesitant. “Then the time got away from us.” Does she ever regret it? “Sometimes, yes.” On the other hand, she says, “I love what I do so much that I don’t feel like I’ve sacrificed.”</p>
<h2 class="h2x">The Art of Subtraction</h2>
<p class="noindent">If there is one habit that all of the investors in this chapter have in common, it’s this: <b>They focus almost exclusively on what they’re best at and what matters most to them. Their success derives from this fierce insistence on concentrating deeply in a relatively narrow area while disregarding countless distractions that could interfere with their pursuit of excellence.</b></p>
<p class="indent">Jason Zweig, an old friend who is a personal finance columnist at the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> and the editor of a revised edition of <i>The Intelligent Investor</i>, once wrote to me, “Think of Munger and Miller and Buffett: guys who just won’t spend a minute of time or an iota of mental energy doing or thinking about anything that doesn’t make them better.… Their skill is self-honesty. They don’t lie to themselves about what they are and aren’t good at. Being honest with yourself like that has to be part of the secret. It’s so hard and so painful to do, but so important.”</p>
<p class="indent">I think this applies to any elusive skill that we hope to master, whether it’s picking stocks, healing patients, or wrestling with words. One of my heroes is the late Oliver Sacks, an eminent neurologist and a superb author, who put up a big yellow sign in his house with the word NO! written on it in block letters. In a memoir, he explained that it was his way of “reminding myself to say no to invitations, so I could preserve writing time.”</p>
<p class="indent">Thousands of years earlier, the Taoist philosopher Lao-tzu wrote that the path to wisdom involves “subtracting” all unnecessary activities: “To attain knowledge, add things every day. To attain wisdom, subtract things every day.”</p>
<p class="indent"><b>The art of subtraction is incalculably important, particularly in an</b> <span aria-label="page 196" id="page_196" role="doc-pagebreak"/><b>age of information overload when our minds can so easily become scattered.</b> If you expose yourself to it, there’s a deafening din of discordant political news, social media notifications, robocalls, and other disruptive noise. In <i>World Without Mind: The Existential Threat of Big Tech</i>, Franklin Foer warns, “We’re being dinged, notified, and clickbaited, which interrupts any sort of possibility for contemplation. To me, the destruction of contemplation is the existential threat to our humanity.”</p>
<p class="indent">It’s also an existential threat to investment success. Hence Geritz regularly disappears to sit beside a waterfall on a mountainside in Kyoto where she can read, write, and muse. The late Bill Ruane, who generated fabulous returns at the Sequoia Fund, once spoke to me from what he called “my hideaway”—a hotel suite in New York City where he worked alone, disconnected from colleagues in his nearby office. Guy Spier, who has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, moved his family from Manhattan to a rented house in a quiet neighborhood of Zurich, where it’s easier for his beautiful but distractible mind to resemble “a calm pond.” Spier’s office, which is a short tram-ride from his home, has a library in which he doesn’t permit himself a phone or a computer. He has consciously designed his physical environment to support contemplation.</p>
<p class="indent">As the head of an investment team with more than $100 billion to manage, Matthew McLennan could fill every hour of every day with meetings and calls. “You can make yourself very busy,” he says. “But you have to remove unproductive busyness.… And I think creating windows for sustained reflection is very important.” He schedules no appointments in the mornings, keeps Fridays “relatively unscheduled,” and is “very systematic” in carving out time away from his office during the workweek. He also exercises regularly as a way of clearing his mind and often walks in nature on weekends. McLennan explains, “Removing yourself from a frenetic environment from time to time is very helpful.”</p>
<p class="indent"><b>The more distracted others become, the more of an advantage it is to subtract mental clutter, technological intrusions, and overstimulation.</b> But the details differ for each of us. Ruane found a calm refuge in the middle of Manhattan. Chuck Akre, who has beaten the market by a <span aria-label="page 197" id="page_197" role="doc-pagebreak"/>huge margin over three decades, finds it easier to think with equanimity in rural Virginia, where his firm, Akre Capital Management, is based in a small town with one traffic light. He lives in a house that looks out on the Blue Ridge Mountains. “We see deer and bears and foxes and coyotes and wild turkeys,” he says. “It’s a beautiful place. It’s good for the soul.” One benefit of being there is that he feels so distant from all “the stupidity and the nonsense” that he doesn’t get “uptight about what’s going on in the market and the world.… We just turn it off.”</p>
<p class="indent">Instead, he focuses narrowly on owning a few well-run businesses that earn attractive returns on capital and have the ability to keep reinvesting their free cash flow at high rates of return. And then he has the restraint to “leave things well alone.” He has held Markel for twenty-seven years and made more than one hundred times his money. He has owned Berkshire Hathaway for forty-two years. His largest holding, American Tower Corporation, has risen from seventy-nine cents per share to about $260 since 2002. By constructing an unhurried life in a tranquil place, Akre can “shelter” himself from the influence of other investors’ “brilliant ideas” and “stay focused completely on the things that work for us.” In essence, he’s discovered one well-stocked pond, and he’s content to fish there for the rest of his days. Or, as Akre puts it, “We can’t dance with all the ladies.”</p>
<p class="indent">All of this leads to a few practical conclusions that can help us to become wealthier <i>and</i> happier. First, to be successful and fulfilled, we need to decide what we care about most and be honest with ourselves about what we do best. Second, we need to adopt daily habits that enable us to improve continuously where it truly counts—and to subtract habits that divert us. It’s worth writing down a list of beneficial habits that should be part of our daily routine. But it’s equally valuable to compile a Do Not Do list, reminding us of all the ingenious ways in which we habitually distract or undermine ourselves. As Gayner suggests, the point is not to push for perfection, but to commit to habits that are sustainable and directionally correct.</p>
<p class="indent">Michael Zapata, a hedge fund manager who was previously a commander in an elite counterterrorist unit, SEAL Team Six, has thought hard about the necessity of focus. “You have to know what your priorities are in life,” he says. “For me, it’s God, family, fund—in that order.” <span aria-label="page 198" id="page_198" role="doc-pagebreak"/>That clarity helps him to decide how to spend his time and energy so he’s “aligned” with what matters most to him. “Even this conversation is sort of outside of that alignment because it doesn’t fit into the family-fund-God thing,” he says. “But it’s okay to have that. You just have to make sure that it doesn’t throw you off your priorities… that it doesn’t affect your life.”</p>
<p class="indent">Is that too extreme? Maybe. But most people make the mistake of adding too much complexity to their lives. They skim the surface, preoccupying themselves with the superficial and the extraneous. As the best investors show, sustained excellence requires us to subtract and go deep.</p>
