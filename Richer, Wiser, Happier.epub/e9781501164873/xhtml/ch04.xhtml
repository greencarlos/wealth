<p class="chsub">How to build enduring wealth and survive the wildness that lies in wait</p>
<p class="imageq"><img alt="Image" src="../images/common01.jpg"/></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote1">
<p class="chepi">The real trouble with this world of ours is not that it is an unreasonable world, nor even that it is a reasonable one. The commonest kind of trouble is that it is nearly reasonable, but not quite. Life is not an illogicality; yet it is a trap for logicians. It looks just a little more mathematical and regular than it is: its exactitude is obvious, but its inexactitude is hidden; its wildness lies in wait.</p>
<p class="chepiatt">—G. K. Chesterton</p>

<p class="noindent">As a young investment analyst at Société Générale in Paris in the 1960s, Jean-Marie Eveillard had no idea what he was doing. His bosses indoctrinated him in the conventional stock-picking strategy of their era. “Basically, their game was to trade actively the big stocks in the index, and that was all,” he says. Like everyone around him, he obediently followed this respectable path to mediocre returns. As he would later observe, “It’s much warmer inside the herd.”</p>
<p class="indent">Eveillard began to stray in 1968 after the bank posted him to New York. That summer, he was biking in Central Park with two French students from Columbia Business School. They told him about Benjamin Graham, who’d developed the discipline of value investing while teaching there in the 1920s.<sup class="sup"><a href="footnotes.xhtml#footnote-037" id="footnote-037-backlink">I</a></sup> Eveillard read his books <i>Security Analysis</i> and <span aria-label="page 84" id="page_84" role="doc-pagebreak"/><i>The Intelligent Investor</i> and instantly saw the light. He compares his discovery of Graham to the religious conversion of Paul Claudel, a French writer who found God spontaneously while standing in Notre-Dame cathedral in 1886: “I was illuminated by Ben Graham’s approach. I had found what I was looking for.” Eveillard tried to convince his bosses to let him invest according to his new beliefs, but they hadn’t heard of Graham and couldn’t see the attraction of his alien philosophy. So Eveillard kept playing the game the old way. In all, he says, “I wasted fifteen years of my professional life.”</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, at the age of thirty-nine, he was set free. The bank made him the manager of SoGen International, a mutual fund so small and obscure that nobody cared what he did with it. When Eveillard took charge in 1979, the fund had only $15 million in assets. Based in Manhattan, he worked alone for years, relishing the lack of interference from his corporate overlords back in France.</p>
<p class="indent">His new investment strategy was built on one all-important insight that he drew from <i>The Intelligent Investor</i>. <b>“Because the future is uncertain, you want to minimize your risk,” says Eveillard.</b> Like most great truths, it is so simple that it’s easy to miss its significance, to gloss over its surface without internalizing its far-reaching implications.</p>
<p class="indent">It was a lesson that Graham had learned from harrowing experience. Born in London in 1894, he grew up in a prosperous household in New York, supported by a family business that imported porcelain from Europe. But Graham’s father died at thirty-five, leaving his widow to raise three sons on her own. The business collapsed, so she converted their home into a boardinghouse, which also failed. To make matters worse, she borrowed money to buy shares and was cleaned out in the Panic of 1907, when the stock market lost nearly half its value within weeks. Graham, who had grown up with a cook, a maid, and a governess, later recalled the “shame at our disgrace” when the family was forced to sell its possessions in a public auction.</p>
<p class="indent"><span aria-label="page 85" id="page_85" role="doc-pagebreak"/>These childhood memories alone could have explained Graham’s fixation on how to achieve resilience in the face of uncertainty. But in the years that followed, he confronted a series of calamities: World War I, the Crash of 1929, and the Great Depression. After making a fortune as a money manager in the 1920s bull market, he lost 70 percent from 1929 to 1932. These experiences led him to a disturbing realization: <b>“The future of security prices is never predictable.”</b></p>
<p class="indent">Forged in fire, Graham constructed an investment credo that prioritized survival. He summed it up in the final chapter of <i>The Intelligent Investor</i>, which was written in the wake of the Holocaust: “In the old legend the wise men finally boiled down the history of mortal affairs into the single phrase, ‘This too will pass.’ Confronted with a like challenge to distill the secret of sound investment into three words, we venture the motto, MARGIN OF SAFETY.”<sup class="sup"><a href="footnotes.xhtml#footnote-036" id="footnote-036-backlink">II</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Graham explained that a margin of safety could be attained by buying stocks and bonds at a “favorable” discount to their “appraised value.” That gap between price and value would provide a cushion to absorb the impact of an investor’s own “miscalculations,” “worse than average luck,” and “the unknown conditions of the future.” It was a worldly-wise strategy, built on a recognition of human frailty and the hazards of history. <i>We make mistakes. We have bad luck. The future is unknown.</i></p>
<p class="indent">Graham concluded that buying undervalued assets would give investors “a better chance for profit than for loss,” but he warned that this was <i>still</i> no guarantee that a specific investment wouldn’t go horribly wrong. The solution? Diversification.</p>
<p class="indent">Eveillard, like Graham, was a child of uncertainty. He was born in the French city of Poitiers in 1940, just months before Germany invaded the country. His wary, fretful, slightly mournful view of life was influenced by sermons he heard as a child while visiting his grandmother’s Roman Catholic church in the French countryside. Speaking to a community that had suffered the recent trauma of defeat, blood<span aria-label="page 86" id="page_86" role="doc-pagebreak"/>shed, and bombing, the priest would say, “Don’t count on being happy on this earth. This is a valley of tears. You can only be happy in the afterworld.”<sup class="sup"><a href="footnotes.xhtml#footnote-035" id="footnote-035-backlink">III</a></sup> Thus Eveillard was primed to accept Graham’s warnings that investors must expect and withstand adversity.</p>
<p class="indent">In Graham’s heyday, there were so many distressed assets in the United States that he didn’t need to look for bargains overseas. But Eveillard cloned and then modified the strategy for another era, scavenging globally for stocks that cost at least 30–40 percent less than his estimate of their value. He based his appraisals on a conservative view of what a reasonable acquirer might pay in cash for the entire company. To borrow Graham’s phrase, this was an approach based “not on optimism, but on arithmetic.” For good measure, Eveillard routinely owned more than one hundred stocks. Buffett and Munger had the stomach to hold a more concentrated portfolio, but Eveillard couldn’t bring himself to do it. “I’m too skeptical about my own skills,” he admits, “and too worried that it could just blow up.”</p>
<p class="indent">His strategy worked, and he earned a reputation for high returns with low risks. <i>Business Week</i> and Morningstar feted him. Financial planners and brokers flooded him with their clients’ assets. He hired a team of analysts and launched two new funds. Still, he never lost his sense of trepidation. As his funds grew, Eveillard felt the burden of managing money for hundreds of thousands of investors saving for retirement or their children’s education. “It’s money they cannot afford to lose,” he says. “If I screwed up, I was very aware of the fact that I was making daily life more difficult for the investors in my funds.… That pushed me to try to be cautious.”</p>
<p class="indent">Eveillard’s rigorous focus on valuation kept his shareholders safe. For example, in the late 1980s, investors were so infatuated with Japan that asset prices ceased to reflect economic reality. By 1989, Japan accounted for 45 percent of the world’s stock market capitalization—more than the United States and the UK combined—and most of the world’s largest companies were Japanese. Eveillard exited Japan entirely <span aria-label="page 87" id="page_87" role="doc-pagebreak"/>in 1988, unable to find a single Japanese stock that met his valuation requirements. The bubble burst in late 1989, and Japanese stocks fell into a decades-long death spiral. At its low in 2009, the Nikkei 225 stock index had lost more than 80 percent in twenty years. During one of our conversations, Eveillard marveled that, in 2020, the Japanese market was “<i>still</i> 30 percent below where it was thirty years ago.”</p>
<p class="indent">In a preface to <i>The Intelligent Investor</i>, Buffett wrote, “To invest successfully over a lifetime does not require a stratospheric IQ, unusual business insights, or inside information. What’s needed is a sound intellectual framework for making decisions and the ability to keep emotions from corroding that framework.” How did Eveillard measure up? His intellectual framework, with its time-tested emphasis on the margin of safety, was sound. He also had the emotional strength to distance himself from the crowd, resisting any temptation to relax his standards when others were gunning the engine. For a while, he enjoyed one other critical advantage: he had the institutional latitude to go his own way, partly because he worked nearly four thousand miles from his firm’s headquarters and partly because his returns gave nobody cause to complain or meddle.</p>
<p class="indent">These were prerequisites for outperformance. But as Eveillard would soon discover, there are forces that conspire almost irresistibly to produce fragility and humdrum returns. We need to understand those forces because they are remorseless enemies of resilience. In this chapter, we’ll see what it took for Eveillard and his brilliant successor, Matthew McLennan, to navigate that minefield, producing an outstanding record over more than four decades. Their thinking offers many lessons on how to build—and <i>keep</i>—a fortune over your investment lifetime.</p>
<h2 class="h2x">“To Lag Is to Suffer”</h2>
<p class="noindent">Eveillard’s troubles began in 1997. By then, he had an eighteen-year record of avoiding mishap and beating the market. In his worst year—1990—SoGen International had lost a paltry 1.3 percent. Along the way, his assets under management had soared to $6 billion. Unexpectedly, the threat to his financial fortress came not from a market meltdown but a frenzy of speculation.</p>
<p class="indent"><span aria-label="page 88" id="page_88" role="doc-pagebreak"/>From January 1997 to March 2000, the tech-heavy Nasdaq index rose 290 percent, fueled by a mania for internet and telecom stocks. To appreciate the thrilling absurdity of those times, consider the rise and fall of theGlobe.com: the social media site went public in 1998, saw its stock price surge 606 percent on its first day of trading, and was delisted by Nasdaq in 2001 when the stock was languishing below $1. Or consider the fate of eToys: the online retailer went public in May 1999 at $20 per share, peaked at $84 that October, and went bankrupt eighteen months later. Or consider Cisco Systems: the networking firm’s market value rocketed from $100 billion to $500 billion in less than five hundred days, making it (briefly) the world’s biggest company; then the bubble burst and the stock plunged 86 percent.</p>
<p class="indent">Eveillard, a man who fretted for a living, refused to board the roller coaster. Analytically, it wasn’t a hard decision, given the ludicrous valuations and the notorious difficulty of predicting which tech companies will endure and which will flame out. But he took the extreme position of owning no tech at all. It requires real bravery for fund managers to diverge radically from the market indexes because, if they’re wrong, they can jeopardize their entire career. That’s particularly unappealing if you’re married, have kids, or just fancy the idea of preserving your luxurious lifestyle. An easier option is to “underweight” certain stocks or sectors, instead of avoiding them entirely. The specter of “career risk” helps to explain why many funds “hug” the index, condemning themselves to unexceptional returns but sparing themselves exceptional grief.</p>
<p class="indent">Eveillard, who has a streak of indomitable obstinacy, did not take the easy option. As a result, he lagged the market by miles for three long years while tech stocks went nuts. In 1998 alone, the Nasdaq gained 39.6 percent and the MSCI World Index gained 24.3 percent, while SoGen International <i>lost</i> 0.3 percent. The following year, SoGen International roared back, returning 19.6 percent. Pretty good, right? Wrong. That year, the Nasdaq shot up 85.6 percent. Eveillard’s relative returns looked pitiful in an era when any buffoon could hit the jackpot, and his shareholders weren’t inclined to thank him for acting responsibly. On the contrary, his prudence started to seem like slow professional suicide.</p>
<p class="indent"><span aria-label="page 89" id="page_89" role="doc-pagebreak"/>“To lag is to suffer,” says Eveillard. “It becomes psychologically painful, but also financially painful.… After one year, your shareholders are upset. After two years, they’re furious. After three years, they’re gone.” Indeed, SoGen lost 70 percent of its shareholders in less than three years, and its assets under management dwindled from more than $6 billion to barely $2 billion.</p>
<p class="indent">Understandably, his bosses were not amused. His employer, Société Générale, seldom fired anyone. “If they thought you couldn’t do the job anymore, they put you in a small office with nothing to do.” Still, in 1999, he began to think the unthinkable: “Maybe they’ll kick me out.”</p>
<p class="indent">The mutual fund business can be marvelously profitable. It’s not capital intensive, and it boasts unusually high operating margins. The late Marty Whitman, a renowned investor with a gift for tactless truth-telling, once told me that fund managers are competitive in every way—except when it comes to lowering their fees. The executives who run mutual fund companies have strong incentives to keep gathering assets. They’re not fools or villains. They’re pragmatic businesspeople who focus heavily on sales and marketing. An outperformer such as Eveillard was a prized asset in good times. But in bad times, it was easy to cast him as a zealot whose extremism placed everyone’s bonuses at risk. If credulous investors wanted to buy dot-com stocks, why not give them what they wanted? Why not feed the ducks while they were quacking?</p>
<p class="indent">The pressure was palpable. Eveillard heard that one senior executive had grumbled behind his back that he was “half-senile.” Eveillard, who was only fifty-nine, reported the incident to his wife, Elizabeth, a battle-hardened investment banker. “My wife did not even lift her eyes from the magazine she was reading. She said, ‘Only half?’ ” Another executive analyzed the alarming rate of redemptions from SoGen’s funds and claimed to have “figured out the exact date, which was not very distant, at which we would be left with zero to manage.”</p>
<p class="indent">Eveillard felt under siege. “Even the board of the fund went against me. They said, ‘How come you don’t see what everybody else is seeing, which is that you have to be in the tech, media, and telecom stocks?” He tried to explain that his investment style was ill-suited to fast-changing sectors filled with racy companies trading at irrational valuations. But <span aria-label="page 90" id="page_90" role="doc-pagebreak"/>he sounded out of touch—a relic who didn’t understand the wondrous innovations of the New Economy.</p>
<p class="indent">He’d always expected to suffer bouts of underperformance. In the past, he’d trailed the market for several months at a time. <i>But three years?</i> “It had gone on for so long that there were days when I thought I was an idiot,” he confesses. “You do, in truth, start doubting yourself.… Everybody seems to see the light. How come <i>I</i> don’t see it?”</p>
<p class="indent">Was it possible that the markets had changed beyond recognition and his investing style was no longer applicable? Julian Robertson, a hedge fund legend who’d generated stunning returns for two decades by betting on undervalued stocks and shorting overvalued stocks, closed his funds in early 2000. “In a rational environment, this strategy functions well,” Robertson grumbled. “But in an irrational market, where earnings and price considerations take a back seat to mouse clicks and momentum, such logic, as we have learned, does not count for much.”</p>
<p class="indent">Still, Eveillard struggled on, refusing to abandon logic or retire. His mother once told him that he’d found the only occupation in which he could be reasonably successful: “I think she may be right. On top of that, I only know how to do value investing.… I could not operate differently.”</p>
<p class="indent">In the end, Société Générale found a tactful way to get rid of him. It sold his fund group to a small investment bank, Arnhold &amp; S. Bleichroeder. Eveillard, who owned a 19.9 percent stake in the fund business, had worked at the same firm since 1962. Now, after three years of dismal underperformance, he was traded to another team like some washed-out athlete.</p>
<p class="indent">The sale was almost comically mistimed. It was announced in October 1999 and the deal closed in January 2000. Two months later, on March 10, the tech bubble burst.</p>
<p class="indent">Eveillard’s portfolio of bargain-priced stocks performed superbly as rationality reasserted itself. His flagship investment vehicle, now renamed the First Eagle Global Fund, trounced the Nasdaq by 49 percentage points in 2000, 31 percentage points in 2001, and 42 percentage points in 2002. Morningstar anointed Eveillard the International Stock Fund Manager of the Year for 2001. In 2003, he received Morn<span aria-label="page 91" id="page_91" role="doc-pagebreak"/>ingstar’s inaugural Lifetime Achievement Award in recognition of his “outstanding long-term performance,” alignment with his shareholders’ best interests, and “courage to differ from consensus.”</p>
<p class="indent">Investors are a fickle bunch. One year, Eveillard was a fossil and a fool. The next, he was a sage, revered by all. So much money poured in that his assets under management eventually rose to about $100 billion. His former bosses had sold the business at the bottom for “five percent of its worth today,” he says, with a mixture of resentment, sorrow, and satisfaction. “Somebody told me that shortly afterwards they were eating their balls.”</p>
<p class="indent">Graham, who had also suffered on the road to glory, wouldn’t have been surprised by the tale of Eveillard’s rise and fall and rise. Graham opened <i>Security Analysis</i> with a quote from the Roman poet Horace: “Many shall be restored that now are fallen and many shall fall that now are in honor.”</p>
<h2 class="h2x">The Unkindness of Strangers</h2>
<p class="noindent">Eveillard had done everything right, yet his career was almost destroyed. So what’s the lesson of his story? Above all, it highlights just how difficult it is to build sustainable investment success over decades, given the multitude of destabilizing forces and unpredictable hazards we encounter along the way.</p>
<p class="indent">Unlike many of his peers, Eveillard had some powerful advantages. He had the good fortune to stumble upon Graham’s value-oriented principles, which gave him an analytical edge. He had the discipline to adhere to those principles through thick and thin, resisting the allure of overvalued stocks. And he had the emotional fortitude to endure his colleagues’ contempt and override his own doubts. In short, he belonged to a small minority that’s equipped intellectually and temperamentally to outperform over the long haul. Even so, these formidable strengths weren’t sufficient to make him a truly resilient investor. How come?</p>
<p class="indent">The trouble was, Eveillard operated from a position that was <i>structurally</i> unsound. First, he was at the mercy of his investors, since they <span aria-label="page 92" id="page_92" role="doc-pagebreak"/>could redeem their shares daily, forcing him to sell stocks when they were cheapest, instead of buying them. Their wayward emotions and erratic judgment posed an external threat over which he had no control. Second, he was acutely vulnerable to pressures from inside his own firm, including his colleagues’ concern that he threatened their financial interests by refusing to invest in tech. Even worse, he served at the pleasure (or displeasure) of his corporate masters. He wasn’t in charge.</p>
<p class="indent">It’s hard enough to make rational decisions in a crazy market that has renounced traditional valuation measures. It’s infinitely harder if you’re also barraged by external pressures from shareholders jumping ship, colleagues with their own commercial agenda, and bosses who lose faith in you at precisely the wrong moment. As you can see from Eveillard’s travails, fragility comes in many forms. So it follows that <i>financial resilience must also be multifaceted</i>.</p>
<p class="indent">It’s revealing that Buffett and Munger have structured Berkshire Hathaway to be resilient in every way. For example, they’ve vowed never to keep less than $20 billion in cash, so they’ll never be caught out by a shortage of liquidity. When COVID-19 caused a market crash in 2020, Berkshire had $137 billion in cash, making it indestructible even in the face of unprecedented uncertainty. Buffett and Munger also buy high-quality businesses that should prosper for decades, even in times of turmoil or inflation. And their insurance operations are vastly overcapitalized, so they can withstand catastrophes that would bury weaker firms.</p>
<p class="indent">Berkshire also has the structural advantage of being a public company, not a fund, so they’re investing permanent capital that can never be yanked away by panicked shareholders. “If you run a mutual fund, you’re always worried that the shareholder will abandon you if you’re temporarily not doing well,” says Eveillard. “To some extent, what Buffett has with Berkshire Hathaway is a closed-end fund. He <i>can’t</i> suffer from redemptions.”</p>
<p class="indent">During the financial crisis, Berkshire’s stock took a hit, plunging 50.7 percent from September 2008 to March 2009. But this short-term market volatility had zero impact on the long-term value of the business. On the contrary, Buffett used the crisis to boost Berkshire’s value by injecting billions of dollars on preferential terms into wounded <span aria-label="page 93" id="page_93" role="doc-pagebreak"/>giants such as Goldman Sachs, General Electric, and Bank of America. Guy Spier, whose hedge fund has owned Berkshire for more than twenty years, says Buffett has systematically set himself up to be “the last man standing.”</p>
<p class="indent">In <i>A Streetcar Named Desire</i>, Blanche DuBois says, “I have always depended on the kindness of strangers.” It’s a sweet sentiment, except that she’s gone mad and is speaking to a doctor who has come to lock her away. In his 2018 letter to shareholders, Buffett added his own twist, pledging, “Charlie and I <i>never</i> will operate Berkshire in a manner that depends on the kindness of strangers—or even that of friends who may be facing liquidity problems of their own.… We have intentionally constructed Berkshire in a manner that will allow it to comfortably withstand economic discontinuities, including such extremes as extended market closures.”</p>
<p class="indent">If our goal is financial resilience, it’s probably best to clone Buffett, not Blanche. So we need to make sure that we, too, will get along just fine without the kindness of strangers. As a fund manager, Eveillard couldn’t escape from his dependence on others. But individual investors have one significant advantage: they’re not answerable to trigger-happy shareholders or any other disgruntled critics (except, perhaps, their own family members).</p>
<p class="indent">How, then, can individuals reduce their vulnerability and bolster their resilience? <b>Following Buffett’s lead, we should always keep enough cash in reserve so we’ll never be forced to sell stocks (or any other beleaguered asset) in a downturn. We should never borrow to excess because, as Eveillard warns, debt erodes our “staying power.” Like him, we should avoid the temptation to speculate on hot stocks with supposedly glorious growth prospects but no margin of safety. And we should bypass businesses with weak balance sheets or a looming need for external funding, which is liable to disappear in times of distress.</b></p>
<p class="indent">None of this is brain surgery. But it requires us to take seriously that oft-forgotten commandment <i>Thou shalt not depend on the kindness of strangers.</i></p>
<h2 class="h2x"><span aria-label="page 94" id="page_94" role="doc-pagebreak"/>The Long Game</h2>
<p class="noindent">It also helps if we’re not in an excessive rush to get rich. In 2014, I asked Irving Kahn to share the most important lessons of his extraordinarily long career. By then, he was 108 years old and had worked on Wall Street since 1928. Nobody in the investment business had survived more turmoil, so I regarded him as the living embodiment of financial (and biological) resilience.<sup class="sup"><a href="footnotes.xhtml#footnote-034" id="footnote-034-backlink">IV</a></sup> Kahn was too frail to see me in person. But his grandson Andrew—an analyst at the family’s investment firm, Kahn Brothers—read him my questions and wrote down his answers. It turned out that this was Kahn’s final interview as he died just three months later at the age of 109.</p>
<p class="indent">Kahn became Graham’s teaching assistant at Columbia in the 1920s, and they remained friends for decades. I wanted to know what he’d learned from Graham that had helped him to prosper during his eighty-six years in the financial markets. Kahn’s answer: “Investing is about <i>preserving</i> more than anything. That must be your first thought, not looking for large gains. If you achieve only reasonable returns and suffer minimal losses, you will become a wealthy man and will surpass any gambler friends you may have. This is also a good way to cure your sleeping problems.”</p>
<p class="indent"><b>As Kahn put it, the secret of investing could be expressed in one word: “safety.” And the key to making intelligent investment decisions was always to begin by asking, “How much can I lose?”</b> He explained, “Considering the downside is the single most important thing an investor must do. This task must be dealt with before any consideration can be made for gains. The problem is that people nowadays think they’re pretty smart because they can do something quite rapidly. You can make the horse gallop. But are you on the right path? Can you see where you’re going?”</p>
<p class="indent"><span aria-label="page 95" id="page_95" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Kahn’s defensive mindset reminds me of the warning that’s pounded into the heads of medical students: “First, do no harm.” For investors, that instruction requires a minor tweak: <i>First, do no self-harm</i>. When we try to explain investment success, we’re naturally drawn to racier aspects of the game. It’s more fun to tell tales of bold bets that earned billions than to drone on about all of the accidents that never happened. But accident avoidance matters because it’s so hard to recover from disaster. Consider the brutal mathematics of financial loss: if you lose 50 percent on an ill-considered bet, you’ll need a 100 percent gain just to get back to where you started.</p>
<p class="indent">What made Eveillard an enduring giant of global investing was that he avoided losses by repeatedly escaping the deadliest dangers in his path. It was a triumph of omission, not commission. Looking back on his career at SoGen and First Eagle, he says, “To the extent that we’ve been successful over the decades, it’s due mostly to what we did <i>not</i> own. We owned no Japanese stocks in the late eighties. We owned no tech in the late nineties. And we didn’t own any financial stocks to speak of between 2000 and 2008.” His ability to sidestep those three disasters over three decades made all the difference between failure and success.</p>
<h2 class="h2x">Everything Fades</h2>
<p class="noindent">Eveillard retired as a fund manager in 2008 and moved to a senior adviser role at First Eagle. He passed the torch to Matthew McLennan, a thirty-nine-year-old Australian, who started in the job one week before Lehman Brothers went up in smoke and the global financial system began to fall apart. Today, with more than $100 billion in assets and millions of shareholders in his funds, McLennan is one of the world’s most influential investors—and one of the most thoughtful.</p>
<p class="indent">At first glance, he could hardly be more different from his predecessor. Eveillard, with his hangdog facial expression and somber worldview, reminds me of Eeyore in <i>Winnie-the-Pooh</i>—a melancholy figure who lives in a spot that’s marked on the map as “Eeyore’s Gloomy Place: Rather Boggy and Sad.” McLennan, almost three decades younger, <span aria-label="page 96" id="page_96" role="doc-pagebreak"/>exudes bright-eyed enthusiasm and easygoing charm. Almost every sentence he utters is accompanied by a smile.</p>
<p class="indent">But as investors, Eveillard and McLennan have much in common. When they first met in 2008, they shared war stories about the tech bubble. McLennan, who had been running a value-oriented global investment portfolio at Goldman Sachs, recounted his own experience of refusing to buy into a mania that offered no margin of safety. Eveillard approved. “He took comfort in the fact that I was willing to be ‘short’ social acceptance and stand apart from the herd,” says McLennan. “It’s lonely sometimes if you’re not part of the fad of the moment.… And so we struck a bond.”</p>
<p class="indent">McLennan’s unconventional background helps to explain his readiness to take the road less traveled. Born in 1969, he spent the first six years of his life in Papua New Guinea, where his father (a surveyor) and mother (a physiotherapist and artist) moved in search of adventure. When I joke that he is Papua’s most famous investor, he replies, “Sample size of one.” His parents, whom he describes as “freethinkers” who “felt no need for conventional signs of accumulation,” later bought an idyllic piece of land in Australia that was bordered on one side by rain forest. They couldn’t obtain permits to connect to the electricity grid, so McLennan spent much of his youth without creature comforts, detached from the “normal, literal buzz of existence.”</p>
<p class="indent">The house was full of books, but it didn’t have hot running water. So he showered under a tree, using water from a black plastic bag that had been left to warm up in the afternoon sun. They had no refrigerator. Their heating came from a cast-iron stove, which routinely woke him up by smoking him out of the house. “We didn’t have a television for a long time,” he recalls. “But then we got one that my father was able to hook up to the car battery. That didn’t last very long because, relatively soon after getting it, he reversed out of the driveway with the television still attached to the car battery, dragging it through the front door.”</p>
<p class="indent">McLennan spent much of his time reading, often by the light of a gas lamp. He also hung out with his grandfather, “a real thinker” who bought stocks, collected wine, cultivated roses, and reminisced about living in Antarctica as a doctor on a geophysical expedition. McLen<span aria-label="page 97" id="page_97" role="doc-pagebreak"/>nan inherited his family’s passion for intellectual exploration. His conversation is filled with references to great thinkers—from Heraclitus to Thucydides, Montesquieu to Schrödinger. Nothing gives him greater pleasure than the life of the mind: “When I have a thought or I’m developing a way of looking at things that rings true, it’s the same joy as catching a wave.”</p>
<p class="indent">McLennan’s voracious reading led him to the same wary conclusion that Graham and Eveillard had reached: <b>The future is so “intrinsically uncertain” that investors should focus heavily on avoiding permanent losses and building “a portfolio that can endure various states of the world.”</b> As McLennan sees it, we should start by defining our overarching goal, which ought to guide all of our investment choices. He makes the point by quoting the Roman philosopher Seneca: “If one does not know to which port one is sailing, no wind is favorable.” For McLennan, the destination is clear: “Our goal is not to try to become rich quickly. It’s resilient wealth creation.” For almost all of us, this is a much wiser goal than trying to trounce the market.</p>
<p class="indent">McLennan’s “respect for uncertainty” stems in part from his study of history. He’s particularly fascinated by the relative calm of the early 1900s. He points out that an investor surveying the world in, say, 1908–11, had every reason to feel confident about the future. The global economy had enjoyed a long period of unprecedented growth. Asset values seemed reasonable. And it was widely believed that inflation had been vanquished. Why worry? Then all hell broke loose.</p>
<p class="indent">The unsinkable <i>Titanic</i> sank on its maiden voyage in 1912—a reminder that man cannot tame nature. An assassination by a Bosnian revolutionary triggered a chain reaction that precipitated the outbreak of World War I in 1914. The New York Stock Exchange closed for four months during the war, and every major European exchange shut down. The flu pandemic of 1918–19 killed as many as 50 million people. Hyperinflation gripped Germany in 1922, setting the stage for Hitler’s rise to power, which began in 1923. The Crash of 1929 was followed by the Great Depression. Then World War II struck from 1939 to 1945. Thus, a period of calm prosperity gave way to <i>three decades</i> of disaster. Whipsawed by world events, the stock market was ferociously <span aria-label="page 98" id="page_98" role="doc-pagebreak"/>volatile from 1926 to 1945, leaving a generation of investors with a lingering dread of risk.<sup class="sup"><a href="footnotes.xhtml#footnote-033" id="footnote-033-backlink">V</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">A dangerous blunder that investors repeatedly make is to assume that the period ahead will resemble the period they most recently experienced. “But the future can be <i>incredibly</i> different,” says McLennan. “That <i>next</i> generation had a very different life experience from the <i>prior</i> generation.”<sup class="sup"><a href="footnotes.xhtml#footnote-032" id="footnote-032-backlink">VI</a></sup> Buffett made a similar point after 9/11, which cost Berkshire billions of dollars in insurance losses. Writing to shareholders in 2002, he admitted, “We had either overlooked or dismissed the possibility of large-scale terrorism losses.… In short, all of us in the industry made a fundamental underwriting mistake by focusing on experience, rather than exposure.” <b>With that lesson in mind, McLennan focuses considerable attention on his</b> <span class="bolditalic">exposure</span><b>—and on preparing for a future that may look nothing like his recent experience.</b></p>
<p class="indent">When we first spoke in his sleek Manhattan offices in the summer of 2017, he listed a litany of threats to which investors were exposed. For example, he pointed out that the United States had even more debt relative to GDP than before the 2008 financial crisis. Interest rates were so low that savers were being penalized for prudence. The rise of automation was fomenting social and political upheaval. The geopolitical backdrop was fraught with the risk of conflict, not least from China’s emergence as a rival to the US. And a low cost of capital had driven asset prices to exuberant levels, making it hard to find stocks that offered a wide margin of safety. He described these phenomena <span aria-label="page 99" id="page_99" role="doc-pagebreak"/>as “forms of fragility and frailty that history shows it’s dangerous to ignore.”</p>
<p class="indent">McLennan, who views market predictions as “a fool’s errand,” didn’t pretend to know what would come next. However, like Howard Marks, he thinks it’s vital to recognize that “the pricing of risk goes through enormous cycles.… You want to be more willing to commit capital to investments when risk is obviously being well priced, such as late 2008 or 2009. And you want to be more cautious when risk is <i>not</i> being as well priced, like 1999 or 2007 or perhaps today.”</p>
<p class="indent">He likened the situation to living on a fault line in San Francisco. “Maybe we have ten great years ahead of us [and] the earthquake doesn’t surface.” But it would be foolhardy to act as if the threat doesn’t exist. “We just want to acknowledge that there are things that may not play out so well in the future,” he told me. <b>“You want to be structured to participate in the march of mankind, but to survive the dips along the way.”</b> That’s a useful maxim for investing and life.</p>
<p class="indent">When the threat finally surfaced, it was an epidemic, not an earthquake, that triggered a market collapse in early 2020. Speaking that June from a house in Greenwich, Connecticut, that he’d rented to escape from Manhattan during the pandemic, McLennan remarked that the crash—which struck at a time of “complacency” after a decade of almost “uninterrupted growth”—highlighted his belief that “the markets are part of a complex ecosystem that is <i>inherently unpredictable</i>. You know, there was no economist in December of 2019 calling for a COVID disruption to the business cycle.” One key to resilience, then, is to ensure that you’re “prudently positioned” when “things feel good,” since “the future is uncertain and can hold events like this.”</p>
<p class="indent">How does McLennan construct a portfolio to achieve his goal of resilient wealth creation? He starts by envisioning the global markets as one giant block of marble. He then begins “chipping away” every piece that he <i>doesn’t</i> want to own, removing whatever promotes fragility, in order to “sculpt a better outcome.” The guiding principle behind this process is one of “error elimination.” As McLennan explains, there’s a “fundamental insecurity” to this way of thinking. It reflects his recognition that “there are lots of things that can harm us” and that resilience requires him to “eschew them.”</p>
<p class="indent"><span aria-label="page 100" id="page_100" role="doc-pagebreak"/>McLennan has the flexibility to search anywhere in the world for opportunities, since he manages a global fund and an international fund. Most investors would approach the task by seeking out what he calls “heated pockets” of “thematic growth”—fashionable bets such as Brazilian stocks in 2010, social media companies in 2017, or electric cars in 2020. Influenced by their recent experience, investors often load up on whatever has been performing best. But widespread expectations of continued success lead to inflated prices. What’s more, areas of high growth ultimately attract fierce competition. As Marks puts it, “Success carries within it the seeds of failure.”</p>
<p class="indent"><b>If your goal is resilient wealth creation, you can’t operate like a heat-seeking missile.</b> The risks are too extreme because the most popular assets provide no margin of safety. So McLennan begins by chiseling away anything that looks faddish, including countries and sectors that have attracted “indiscriminate” flows of capital. That habit protected his shareholders when the beloved BRICs (Brazil, Russia, India, and China) stumbled and Brazil blew up. He also avoids countries with political systems that don’t respect property rights. That’s you, Russia.</p>
<p class="indent">Likewise, McLennan chips away any company that he believes would add fragility to his portfolio. For example, he avoids business models that are particularly vulnerable to technological change. He’s equally averse to companies with opaque balance sheets, too much leverage, or imprudent management that is “too expeditionary.” That protected him from time bombs such as Enron, Fannie Mae, and all of the banks that imploded during the financial crisis.</p>
<p class="indent">Instead of assuming that successful businesses will grow in perpetuity, McLennan views them through a darker lens, which he has borrowed from science. “I happen to believe that <i>everything</i> is on a path to fade,” he says. “If you think of evolution, ninety-nine percent of species that have ever existed are extinct. And businesses are no exception.”</p>
<p class="indent">He regards the economy as an ecology in which the current lords of the jungle will eventually be defeated by disruptive technology and new competitors. “Businesses that were robust today won’t be robust in the future,” says McLennan. “Uncertainty is intrinsic to the system. It’s entropy—the second law of thermodynamics. Basically, things tend toward disorder over time, and it takes a lot of energy to keep structure <span aria-label="page 101" id="page_101" role="doc-pagebreak"/>and quality in place. So, philosophically, we have great respect for the fact that things are not structurally permanent in nature, that things fade.”</p>
<p class="indent">This realization has profound implications when it comes to picking stocks. Most investors want to own glamorous companies with heady growth prospects. McLennan focuses instead on a more negative mission of “avoiding fade.” How? By identifying “persistent businesses” that are less vulnerable to “complex competitive forces.” Think of it as an anti-entropy strategy.</p>
<p class="indent">One example of a business that he expects to “persist” is FANUC Corp., a Japanese firm that has maintained a remarkably stable position as the world’s leading seller of robotics products such as servomotors. Whatever car you buy in the United States, says McLennan, it’s likely that it was painted by a FANUC robot. The company has an entrenched customer base that’s used to its products. It gathers real-time data from those clients and harnesses this superior knowledge of the market to keep expanding its lead over competitors. FANUC also benefits from the trend of automation within manufacturing, instead of being a victim of technological change. Its finances are strong, with net cash on the balance sheet, and it’s run by a farsighted management team that speaks explicitly about the priority of positioning the company to “survive forever.” None of this guarantees that FANUC is immune to entropy, but McLennan believes it’s “difficult to displace.”</p>
<p class="indent">Another example of a dominant business that he regards as “built for resilience” is the consumer goods firm Colgate-Palmolive. The company has been selling toothpaste since the 1870s and controls more than 40 percent of the worldwide market. It’s an inexpensive and habitual product that’s resistant to disruption—except in the unlikely event that, say, an active ingredient turns out to be carcinogenic. Even in times of economic mayhem, such as 2008 or 2020, it’s a business that “just tends to grind on,” says McLennan. And, as with FANUC, “that combination of scale and customer captivity tends to produce better margins and therefore more cash flow.”</p>
<p class="indent">This is a company with no novelty or sex appeal. Yet its business model would be so hard to replicate that it possesses what McLennan calls “mundane scarcity.” There’s a counterintuitive elegance to this idea <span aria-label="page 102" id="page_102" role="doc-pagebreak"/>that, when it comes to investing, <i>beauty often lies in mundanity, not glamour</i>. Over the years, he’s detected the hidden allure of countless ugly ducklings—from a timberland company acquired during a cyclical downturn to a firm that rents uniforms. Not exactly Tesla.</p>
<p class="indent">Similarly, as stocks tumbled in March 2020, McLennan added to his stake in a Japanese firm, Hoshizaki—another exquisitely mundane and persistent business that he describes as “the world leader in ice machines for restaurants.” He explains, “Restaurants always come and go, but they need the same equipment. So the equipment maker is a far safer bet than betting on a restaurant.”</p>
<p class="indent">McLennan also insists that any stock he buys should be “priced for fade.” In other words, the valuation must be low enough to compensate for his assumption that the company, like every business, is ultimately on “a path to irrelevance.” He typically seeks to invest at a 30 percent discount to his estimate of the company’s intrinsic value. If the business <i>doesn’t</i> fade but instead continues to grow, “then we get the growth for free.”</p>
<p class="indent">What remains after McLennan’s painstaking process of elimination? A “resilient core” of unusually persistent, conservatively managed, well-capitalized, undervalued businesses that are likely to thrive even in a Darwinian ecosystem where nothing lives forever.</p>
<p class="indent">On average, he holds these positions for the best part of a decade, trimming or adding to them as their valuations fluctuate. McLennan recognizes that all of these businesses are imperfect and some will disappoint. So he adds another layer of resilience by owning about 140 of them. Like Graham and Eveillard, he sees diversification as a vital component of an “error-tolerant” strategy that can survive his own mistakes, bad luck, and inability to see the future.<sup class="sup"><a href="footnotes.xhtml#footnote-031" id="footnote-031-backlink">VII</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Opportunities to buy “good businesses at good prices” tend to arise <span aria-label="page 103" id="page_103" role="doc-pagebreak"/>erratically, often amid outbreaks of volatility. But McLennan is perfectly happy to wait five or ten years for a desirable company on his watch list to meet his valuation hurdles. In the meantime, he has the discipline to let cash pile up, instead of feeling obliged to invest when prices are too high for comfort. Indeed, the most critical idea he tries to instill in his analysts is the importance of saying no.</p>
<p class="indent">When markets are ebullient and bargains elude him, McLennan’s capacity for saying no becomes positively Eveillardian. On February 19, 2020, the day before the COVID crash began, First Eagle Global had only 71 percent of its assets in stocks, with 15 percent stashed securely in cash and sovereign debt—a reflection of his concern about high valuations and the brewing risks he’d described back in 2017. He observes, “It’s the fact that we didn’t <i>force</i> capital to work at a time when prices weren’t conducive to investing that helps us to be resilient in the downdraft.”</p>
<p class="indent">McLennan also held 14 percent of the fund’s assets in gold, which he views as a long-term hedge against market meltdowns, geopolitical chaos, or a loss of confidence in paper money systems. “Gold has a negative correlation to stocks in really bad extreme states,” he says. It’s also “one of the scarcest and most resilient elements on the periodic table.… It doesn’t rust, it doesn’t rot, and it doesn’t fade like a business or a regime.” In a world of man-made instability, he argues (unfashionably) that gold adds “natural” resilience to his all-weather portfolio, helping to ensure that he can survive those unexpected dips. After all, companies may die, but gold endures.</p>
<p class="indent">True to form, the Global Fund held up well amid the tumult of 2020, steadied by its “ballast” of cash and gold. “It’s a classic example of the fact that you need to buy the umbrella <i>before</i> it rains,” says McLennan. “By the time you’re hunting around for an umbrella in the middle of a storm, it’s pretty difficult to find one. So having the right mindset in advance was critical here.” While others panicked, he was also able to invest in battered stocks “at prices that were now much more sane.” He observes, “It’s not enough just to be conservative. You need to be willing to put cash to work when others feel least comfortable doing it.”</p>
<p class="indent">McLennan’s resilient approach provides a stark contrast to the behavior of most investors. His systematic focus on removing fragility requires him to avoid all of the “obvious behavioral defects” they <span aria-label="page 104" id="page_104" role="doc-pagebreak"/>exhibit. For example, they’re too impatient to wait for the right purchase price. They “rent” stocks, instead of owning them for years. They succumb to the egotistical delusion that they can predict the future, instead of recognizing the limits of their knowledge. And they leap blindly into manias, their judgment fogged by “return envy” and the fear of missing out.</p>
<p class="indent">One book that has influenced his ideas about why people make such self-destructive decisions is the <i>History of the Peloponnesian War</i>, written by the Athenian general Thucydides some twenty-four hundred years ago. McLennan says Athens and Sparta ended up at war because both sides made “hasty” and “hubristic” decisions “in the passion of the moment.” He reasons that the opposite traits—<i>patience</i> and <i>humility</i>—offer a temperamental edge whether we’re defusing a conflict or building wealth. Once again, success stems from consciously resisting everything that promotes fragility.</p>
<p class="indent">As McLennan describes the process of building a portfolio that can flourish over time, he’s reminded of watching his mother gardening while he was growing up in Australia. There was always a problem. Dry weather. Wilting vines. Bug infestations. He often wondered why she bothered to keep going. It would have been so much easier to let the forest grow or just settle for a lawn that needed mowing once a week. But her care yielded remarkable results over three decades. “What I saw play out over time was the gradual emergence of this beautiful, beautiful garden that took time. It took selectivity. And I think it’s a good metaphor for investing.”</p>
<p class="indent">The First Eagle Global Fund is much like that garden. So much has happened since Eveillard took charge of the fund in 1979—bull markets, bubbles, inflation, wars, crashes, crises, and a pandemic. Yet the same disciplined, risk-averse strategy has remained in place throughout. The result? Since 1979, the fund has averaged 12.46 percent a year, versus 9.35 percent for the MSCI World Index.<sup class="sup"><a href="footnotes.xhtml#footnote-030" id="footnote-030-backlink">VIII</a></sup> If you’d invested $100,000 in the Global Fund in 1979, it would have grown to $12.94 <span aria-label="page 105" id="page_105" role="doc-pagebreak"/>million in 2020, versus $4.05 million if you’d invested in the index—a difference of almost $9 million. That’s the beauty of compounding. Small advantages build over decades into an overwhelming margin of victory.</p>
<p class="indent">The paradox is that Eveillard and McLennan hit the ball out of the park without ever swinging for the fences. McLennan attributes their success to a consistent focus on “risk mitigation,” “error elimination,” and “prudent acts of omission.” In essence, “it’s winning by not losing.”</p>
<h2 class="h2x">“Life Is Not Simple”</h2>
<p class="noindent">Still, the path to prosperity has not been painless. Eveillard, now retired, makes no secret of the emotional scars that he carries from the time when his career almost ran off the rails. Looking back on his life, he also regrets that he struggled to balance work and family. His job was so “absorbing” and “sometimes psychologically painful” that he “neglected” his two daughters. Would he have been a less successful stock picker if he’d given them more attention? “I don’t know, and I’ll never know,” he says. “The Catholic priest was right. Life is not simple.”</p>
<p class="indent">Nonetheless, he feels a deep sense of pride in what he’s achieved. “What gave me pleasure was not that I did better than others, but that I delivered returns over a long period of time that were vastly in excess of an index fund,” he says. “It’s a game where the numbers don’t lie.”</p>
<p class="indent">McLennan, like the rest of us, has also had his share of ups and downs. When I ask how the forces of entropy and impermanence have affected his life, he replies, “Oh, I’ve experienced it personally. You know, I had a wife.” They split up after many years, having had three children together. Since then, he’s fallen in love again, remarried, and had a fourth child—a daughter named Tennyson, “like the poet.”</p>
<p class="indent">Both professionally and personally, says McLennan, he has often found that “moments of extreme pain” were followed by “new beginnings” and “extremely propitious opportunities.” For example, the late nineties were a brutal time for value investors such as him and Eveillard, “but the early 2000s were a golden age. So, if you were able to endure it, the upside was enormous.”</p>
<p class="indent"><span aria-label="page 106" id="page_106" role="doc-pagebreak"/><b>In markets, as in life, so much hinges on our ability to survive the dips.</b></p>
<p class="indent">McLennan spent fourteen years at Goldman Sachs, working with some of the top performers on Wall Street. He initially wondered if the senior brass had some unique talent that set them apart. “What I learned over time is that often it was just the people who didn’t give up, who just kept learning, kept evolving, stuck to it, and were willing to live through adversity.” He sees the same trait among the best investors: “They just haven’t given up. They’re constantly captivated by cracking the code” and have the strength “to endure the inevitable periods of disappointment.”</p>
<p class="indent">McLennan knows that the future will bring more trouble, more instability, more decay. After all, “entropy is the ironclad rule of the universe.” But he thinks of himself as an “informed realist,” not a pessimist. “I’m a believer in human potential, but I think the path is not linear,” he says. “It’s punctured by episodic disruption. So, if you structure your portfolio and your way of thinking to <i>endure</i> those pockets of disruption, you’re more likely to be able to benefit from the march of humankind over time than if you depend on it going well.”</p>
<h2 class="h2x">Five Rules for Resilience</h2>
<p class="noindent">Let’s step back for a moment and try to distill a few practical lessons from Graham, Kahn, Buffett, Eveillard, and McLennan on how to strengthen our resilience as investors. For me, there are five fundamental ideas that I can’t afford to forget.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>First, we need to respect uncertainty.</b> Just think of all the turmoil that Graham and Kahn witnessed over the last century or so and you begin to realize that disorder, chaos, volatility, and surprise are not bugs in the system, but features. We can’t predict the timing, triggers, or precise nature of these disruptions. But we need to expect them and prepare for them, so we can soften their sting. How? By identifying and consciously removing (or reducing) our vulnerabilities. As Nassim Nicholas Taleb writes in <i>Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder</i>, “It is far easier to figure out if something is fragile than to predict the occurrence of an event that may harm it.”</p>
<p class="indent"><span aria-label="page 107" id="page_107" role="doc-pagebreak"/><b>Second, to achieve resilience, it’s imperative to reduce or eliminate debt, avoid leverage, and beware of excessive expenses, all of which can make us dependent on the kindness of strangers.</b> There are two critical questions to ask: “Where am I fragile? And how can I reduce my fragility?” If, say, all of your money is in one bank, one brokerage, one country, one currency, one asset class, or one fund, you may be playing with a loaded gun. With luck, you can get away with anything in the short term. With time, the odds rise that your vulnerability will be exposed by unforeseen events.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Third, instead of fixating on short-term gains or beating benchmarks, we should place greater emphasis on becoming shock resistant, avoiding ruin, and staying in the game.</b> To some degree, the upside will take care of itself as economies grow, productivity improves, populations expand, and compounding works its magic. But as Kahn warned, we can’t afford to ignore the downside.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Fourth, beware of overconfidence and complacency.</b> Aristotle observed, “The character which results from wealth is that of a prosperous fool.” Personally, if there’s anything I’m sure of, it’s that I’m irrational, ignorant, self-deluding, and prone to all of the behavioral mistakes I laugh at in others—including the perilous habit of trusting that the future will resemble the recent past.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Fifth, as informed realists, we should be keenly aware of our exposure to risk and should always require a margin of safety.</b> But there’s an important caveat. We cannot allow our awareness of risk to make us fearful, pessimistic, or paranoid. Nietzsche warned, “Stare too long into the abyss and you become the abyss.” As McLennan demonstrated during the pandemic, the resilient investor has the strength, confidence, and faith in the future to seize opportunities when unresilient investors are reeling. Defense suddenly turns into offense. Disruption brings profit.</p>
