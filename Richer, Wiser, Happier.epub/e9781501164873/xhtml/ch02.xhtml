<p class="chepi">It is impossible to produce superior performance unless you do something different from the majority.</p>
<p class="chepiatt">—Sir John Templeton</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="noindent">Walking along a beach in the Bahamas more than twenty years ago, I stumbled upon a peculiar sight. An old man was immersed up to his neck in the ocean, dressed in a long-sleeved shirt and a ridiculous-looking hat with a visor and earflaps. His face was smothered with thick dollops of sun cream. I ducked behind a palm tree so that he wouldn’t catch me spying on him. Then I watched for several minutes while he pumped his arms and legs back and forth, power walking against the resistance of the water. I later discovered that he did this for forty-five minutes each day.</p>
<p class="indent">The old man was Sir John Templeton, probably the greatest international investor of the twentieth century. I’d traveled from New York to the Bahamas to interview him in his home at the Lyford Cay Club, a gated idyll whose residents have included Prince Rainier III of Monaco, the Aga Khan, and Sean Connery. But if my memory serves me, we weren’t scheduled to meet until the following day. This was the kind of reporting trip that makes a journalist’s heart sing—an interview with a fabled icon in an exotic location, with all expenses paid by a rich magazine that hadn’t yet been clobbered by the advent of the internet.</p>
<p class="indent">Templeton had a spectacular investment record. The Temple<span aria-label="page 32" id="page_32" role="doc-pagebreak"/>ton Growth Fund, which he’d founded in 1954, racked up an average annual return of 14.5 percent over thirty-eight years. A $100,000 stake would have grown to more than $17 million in that time. Templeton, who was born in 1912 in a small town in rural Tennessee, had started out with nothing and ended up a billionaire. I wanted to know how he had done it and what the rest of us could learn from this act of alchemy.</p>
<p class="indent">He was eighty-five at the time, the grand old man of the investment world, and I’d half expected him to look like a sage. Instead, I found myself spellbound by this unlikely image of him marching through the surf in his comical hat. But as I would eventually realize, my glimpse of his fitness regimen provided an important insight into his greatness. Templeton had figured out an efficient way to exercise for free in a gorgeous setting. It was utterly irrelevant to him that anyone might think he looked strange, and this indifference was essential to his success.</p>
<p class="indent">Michael Lipper, the president of an investment firm called Lipper Advisory Services, once remarked to me that Templeton, George Soros, and Warren Buffett shared one invaluable characteristic: “the willingness to be lonely, the willingness to take a position that others don’t think is too bright. They have an inner conviction that a lot of people do not have.”</p>
<p class="indent">That phrase—<i>the willingness to be lonely</i>—has stuck in my mind for many years. It eloquently conveys the critical idea that the best investors are not like other people. They are iconoclasts, mavericks, and misfits who see the world differently from the crowd and follow their own peculiar path—not just in the way they invest but in the way they think and live.</p>
<p class="indent">François Rochon, a Canadian money manager who has beaten the market by a mile over the last quarter of a century, has an intriguing theory. As we all know, the human genetic code developed over hundreds of thousands of years to support the primary objective of survival. One lesson we learned at least two hundred thousand years ago is that it’s safer to belong to a tribe. That unconscious instinct tends to kick in almost irresistibly when we feel under threat, says Rochon. For example, when stocks plummet, the average investor sees others panicking and instinctively follows the tribe by selling stocks and fleeing to <span aria-label="page 33" id="page_33" role="doc-pagebreak"/>the safe haven of cash. What the tribe followers fail to recognize is the counterintuitive truth that this might be the perfect time to <i>buy</i> stocks, since they’re now on sale.</p>
<p class="indent">“But I think some people in the race don’t have that tribal gene,” says Rochon, “so they don’t feel the urge to follow a tribe. And those people can become good investors because they can think for themselves.” Rochon, who uses his talent for stock picking to bankroll his passion for collecting art, suspects that many artists, writers, and entrepreneurs also lack the tribal gene.</p>
<p class="indent">Rochon’s theory is entirely unprovable, but there’s plenty of anecdotal evidence that the best investors are wired in unusual ways that may be financially advantageous. One famed investor who asked not to be quoted by name on this subject told me that many of his most successful peers are “kind of Aspergerish” and that almost all are “unemotional.” He points out that “it’s a help to be unemotional” when making unconventional bets that the crowd would consider foolish. He adds that people with developmental conditions such as Asperger’s syndrome “often have something else in compensation, and very often it’s numeracy.… Being unemotional and [numerate] is a great combination for investing.”</p>
<p class="indent">I mentioned this idea to another hugely successful fund manager who is mathematically gifted and extremely uncomfortable in social situations. He confided, “When I was a child, my parents were concerned that I was autistic or might have a touch of Asperger’s. I think they concluded no. Or, at least, it wasn’t damaging enough. So, yeah, it might be that I’m slightly on the spectrum or not.” He then recalled a devastating childhood trauma that also led him to “distance” himself from his emotions. “So, if you’re thinking I’m a psycho chicken, you may be right.”<sup class="sup"><a href="footnotes.xhtml#footnote-048" id="footnote-048-backlink">I</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">One of the most insightful perspectives on this subject comes from Christopher Davis, who oversees about $25 billion in assets at Davis <span aria-label="page 34" id="page_34" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Advisors, an investment firm founded by his father in 1969. He’s unusually well positioned to observe the idiosyncratic personalities of the most successful investors. He’s friends with high-profile practitioners such as Buffett, Munger, Mason Hawkins, and Bill Miller. Moreover, his grandfather (Shelby Cullom Davis) and father (Shelby M. C. Davis) were both investment legends who amassed colossal fortunes in the stock market.</p>
<p class="indent">“A necessary characteristic of great investors is that they can’t be overly influenced by what other people think,” says Davis. “The easiest way not to be overly influenced by what other people think is not to be that <i>aware</i> of what they think. If you don’t really notice that and don’t really <i>care</i> about what other people think, that will make it easier to be a great investor.” It follows, says Davis, that “a prevalent characteristic in great investors would be low emotional intelligence.” He observes that many of the best investors struggle when it comes to “bonding with others” and nurturing “warm attachments in their family life.”</p>
<p class="indent">By contrast, says Davis, you tend to encounter an entirely different psychological profile among CEOs. They require the emotional intelligence to empathize with others, understand their thoughts, and influence them. But for a contrarian investor, it would be “catastrophic if you were constantly burdened by an awareness of what everybody else was thinking about your decision.” In their youth, he adds, many CEOs played team sports, captained a team, or led a fraternity. What about the best investors? “By and large,” says Davis, they favored individual sports such as “running, tennis, golf, or swimming. You won’t get a lot of football, lacrosse, that sort of thing.”</p>
<p class="indent">His father, now in his eighties, was one of the investment titans of his generation. During Shelby Davis’s twenty-eight years as manager of the New York Venture Fund, a $100,000 investment would have grown to about $3.8 million. So how did he fit the psychological profile painted by his son? “My father was very deeply a loner,” says Davis. “I can’t imagine him playing team sports, being president of a fraternity, or leading a nonprofit.… He just was constantly looking for information, grilling people, and reading annual reports. It was a lonely sort of work. I mean, it was him at a telephone or him and a stack of annual reports and quarterly reports.”</p>
<p class="indent"><span aria-label="page 35" id="page_35" role="doc-pagebreak"/>His description reminds me of Buffett’s politely dismissive response to Mohnish Pabrai after the latter offered to work for him for free: “I simply do best operating by myself.” Indeed, Buffett famously spends much of his time sitting alone in his office in Omaha with the blinds drawn, enraptured by the solitary joy of reading annual reports.</p>
<p class="indent">Beyond these broad patterns, there are plenty of exceptions and nuances. I’m not suggesting that all of the best investors have developmental disorders or lead lonely lives or are destined to divorce (though the list of divorced investment giants is certainly long, including Munger, Miller, Pabrai, Bill Ackman, Carl Icahn, David Einhorn, and countless others). That would be a gross exaggeration. Plus, it’s inane to pathologize every quirk or eccentricity.</p>
<p class="indent">Still, despite these caveats and disclaimers, I think it’s true that all of the investors you’ll meet in this book are nontribal freethinkers. They have a rare capacity to defy conventional opinion. They care much more about being right and winning than gaining social acceptance or approval.</p>
<p class="indent">Matthew McLennan, who oversees more than $100 billion at First Eagle Investment Management, describes his job this way: “Every day you’re trying to understand how the world works—bottom up, top down—and you’re trying to synthesize it in a way that’s different from the consensus.… At the end of the day, we’re paid to see the world through a different prism.”</p>
<p class="indent">The only way to beat the market is to diverge from the market. That’s a task best suited to people who are, quite literally, extraordinary—both intellectually and temperamentally. So perhaps it’s no surprise that this is a game that favors brilliant oddballs. And in my experience, nobody was more brilliant—or odd—than Sir John Templeton.</p>
<p class="indent">A pioneer of global value investing, he figured out entirely for himself a set of principles and practices that can benefit any investor to this day. But looking back now, long after his death in 2008 at the age of ninety-five, I realize that I failed to grasp the most valuable lessons of his life.</p>
<h2 class="h2x"><span aria-label="page 36" id="page_36" role="doc-pagebreak"/>The Making of a Maverick</h2>
<p class="noindent">It was the fall of 1998 when I met Templeton. Even then, a couple of weeks before his eighty-sixth birthday, he still showed up for work each day at his office in the city of Nassau, a short drive from his home. Our day together began in that office, where he greeted me in a genteel manner from a bygone era. “My time is at your discretion,” he said, with a soft Southern twang. “I’ll stay as long as you need me.”</p>
<p class="indent">He was dressed in a pale yellow sports jacket, an open-necked shirt, and gray trousers without a belt. Small, lean, and tanned, he looked fifteen years younger than his age. His office was filled with an unusual range of honors. There was an award for best performance by a mutual fund over thirty-five years; a trophy from PBS television to mark his induction in Louis Rukeyser’s <i>Wall $treet Week</i> Hall of Fame; an entire wall decorated with his honorary degrees; his award for International Churchman of the Year; and his Norman Vincent Peale Award for Positive Thinking.</p>
<p class="indent">Templeton had moved to the Bahamas in the 1960s after a stint in New York. Abandoning his tribe, he renounced his US passport, became a British citizen, and built a house in Lyford Cay. He’d grown up in a devoutly Christian home in Winchester, Tennessee, and his deep-seated faith played a part in his decision to settle in the Bahamas. “This nation has more churches per person than anywhere else in the world,” he informed me, “which makes it very attractive and harmonious.”</p>
<p class="indent">There was also the social allure of the exclusive Lyford Cay Club: “In general, the admissions committee has done a good job of keeping the really top people in the club. So this was a chance to spend our lives with really fascinating people.” He mentioned Joseph Lewis, a commodities billionaire with “the most magnificent yacht I’ve ever seen in my life, other than the queen’s yacht. It’s huge. He’s very private—the kind of fella we like to have here. He’s not flamboyant. I’ve met him in parties. He just quietly does investment trading from his yacht or home.”</p>
<p class="indent">The club boasted its own marina, tennis courts, and beachfront golf course. But Templeton refused to indulge in such decadent frivolities. “My neighbors go out golfing and yachting and so forth. But my own viewpoint is that it’s far more important to be useful,” he said. “I’ve <span aria-label="page 37" id="page_37" role="doc-pagebreak"/>never thought it wise to pursue pleasure.… There must have been some deeper reason why God created human beings. And one of the fairly obvious things is that the people who are busy with some really useful work are happier than the ones who are idle.”</p>
<p class="indent">He was equally adamant about the perils of retirement, which he disdained as “deadly” both for the body and mind. As Templeton saw it, the misguided notion of retiring at sixty-five had created “enormously increased numbers of idle people, <i>useless</i> people” who are “a drag on civilization.” It was my first view of this aspect of his character—a hard-edged, moralistic side that seemed at odds with his old-world charm and courtly manners.</p>
<p class="indent">While others frittered away their lives, Templeton said he was the busiest he’d ever been. He had sold his investment firm for hundreds of millions of dollars a few years earlier. So he now devoted his time to philanthropy, overseeing the money in his charitable foundations, managing his personal fortune, and writing books with titles such as <i>Worldwide Laws of Life: 200 Eternal Spiritual Principles</i>. As we’ll see, his gift for making immense sums of money never deserted him, but his primary passion had shifted to spreading what he called “spiritual wealth.”</p>
<p class="indent">It was a characteristically unconventional crusade. For example, among his many philanthropic initiatives, Templeton spent millions funding scientific research at Harvard Medical School and elsewhere on whether prayer works. He excitedly listed for me some of the many questions he hoped to answer: “Do the people who are prayed for get well quicker? Does the prayer work only if the person who is sick does the praying, or can it be done by somebody else? If it’s done by somebody else, is it important that the person praying put his hands on the person prayed for? Do you pray for the cancer to disappear, or do you pray that God’s will be done?”</p>
<p class="indent">Templeton also funded scientific studies that investigated the benefits of virtues such as forgiveness, humility, honesty, and love. He provided financial incentives for university professors to teach courses on “how science reveals more about God.” He also funded the Templeton Prize for Progress Toward Research or Discoveries about Spiritual Realities, which rewarded “entrepreneurs of the spirit” for “expanding our vision of human purpose and ultimate reality.” Eager to emphasize <span aria-label="page 38" id="page_38" role="doc-pagebreak"/>that these ethereal matters are more important than worldly concerns, he structured the annual award so that it would always be more lucrative than the Nobel Prize. These days, the winner pockets £1.1 million (about $1.4 million).</p>
<p class="indent">This was all part of Templeton’s grandiose campaign to “multiply spiritual information one-hundred-fold.” It was not an endeavor that everyone applauded. At one end of the spectrum, secular scientists were bemused by his interest in measuring experimentally the effects of spiritual principles. At the other extreme, religious conservatives were appalled by his free-spirited readiness to question their beliefs. He recalled a recent encounter with a “nice lady” who asked his opinion about the biblical story of Noah and the flood. He suggested that it was a “useful allegory, but not literal truth.” Her outraged response: “Well, you’re not a Christian.”</p>
<p class="indent">When I asked impertinently if many people regarded him as “a kook,” Templeton replied, “Yes, sure. But I have more self-confidence than the average person.” It struck me that this trait also lay at the heart of his success as an investor. Templeton agreed. “When you’re sticking your neck out, you have to be self-confident enough or brave enough to do it.… I did that in the investment field, and I’m doing it now in the spiritual area.”</p>
<p class="indent">He attributed this attitude to his unusual upbringing: “In all of my childhood I can’t remember either my mother or my father ever telling me, ‘Do this’ or ‘Don’t do that.’ They thought it would help me to become self-reliant and self-confident if I had to do everything myself. And, boy, was that a marvelous education.… It’s the greatest gift, having to rely on yourself.”</p>
<p class="indent">On one occasion, his parents appointed him navigator on a family road trip. Templeton, still a young boy, misread the map and took them an hour or two in the wrong direction. Nobody corrected him. They simply waited until he figured out for himself that he’d made a mistake. This laissez-faire parenting strategy wasn’t without its risks. When Templeton was about eight, his parents granted his request for a shotgun, so he could go out hunting. They also allowed him to buy gunpowder for fireworks and cyanide for his butterfly killing jars.</p>
<p class="indent">Templeton took great pride in his self-reliance. After eleven years <span aria-label="page 39" id="page_39" role="doc-pagebreak"/>of scoring straight A’s at school, he headed to Yale in 1930. Gutted by the Great Depression, his father—a lawyer and businessman—wrote to Templeton at the end of freshman year to say that he could no longer pay “even $1” for his education. Templeton lined up part-time jobs, received scholarship money from Yale, and supplemented his income with winnings from playing poker. At the same time, he worked so hard that he was the top student in his class by the end of his third year.</p>
<p class="indent">It was at Yale that he decided he would make his living as an investor. He loved arithmetic and solving problems methodically. It also seemed like a profession in which he could serve others, helping them to attain the financial security that his own family lacked. The accepted strategy in those days was for Americans to invest exclusively in US assets. But he saw even then that this narrow-mindedness was “contrary to common sense. If a person were going to own stocks and bonds, it would be much wiser to search everywhere, rather than limiting themselves to one nation.”</p>
<p class="indent">After Yale, Templeton spent two years at Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar. He wanted to study business management, but his professors didn’t regard it as a legitimate subject: “They looked at me in a funny way as if I’d told them I wanted to study garbage.” He studied law instead. In his spare time, he read about business. At the time, he could find only one book about investing.</p>
<p class="indent">In the depths of the Depression, the stock market was a toxic wasteland. From October 1929 to July 1932, the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 89 percent. In the wake of that catastrophe, few people had the financial or emotional fortitude to pick through the rubble in search of bargains. But the fact that others were too scared to invest did nothing to diminish Templeton’s interest. Against this backdrop of widespread gloom, he asked himself a critical question: How can I buy a stock for a fraction of what it’s worth? His answer: “Absolutely nothing will make a stock go down to an extremely low price except for other people urgently trying to sell.”</p>
<p class="indent">Templeton had witnessed firsthand how financial distress had forced farmers in Tennessee to sell their land for next to nothing. The lesson was etched in his brain: <b>“You have to buy at a time when other people are desperately trying to sell.”</b> He later coined a marvelous phrase to <span aria-label="page 40" id="page_40" role="doc-pagebreak"/>describe these moments when fear and desperation go viral: “the point of maximum pessimism.”</p>
<p class="indent">In the meantime, Templeton grabbed every opportunity to travel, eager to learn more about foreign markets where he might eventually invest. After graduating from Oxford, he spent seven months visiting twenty-seven countries, carrying a sleeping bag, one change of clothing, four guidebooks, and a Bible. He stayed in Berlin during the 1936 Olympics, which the Nazis used as a propaganda showcase; traveled to Eastern Europe; visited Egypt and Palestine; and even made it to India, Japan, and China. At a time when few Americans ventured overseas, he was already building an informational edge over investors who lacked his insatiable thirst for knowledge.</p>
<p class="indent">Returning to America in 1937, Templeton married, spent three months at a Wall Street brokerage firm called Fenner &amp; Beane, then quit to work for an oil exploration company. By 1939, he’d saved about $30,000. The investment environment could hardly have seemed less inviting even for a seasoned stock picker, let alone a novice. The United States was trapped in a vortex of depression, deflation, and mass unemployment. The Dow, which had peaked at 381 in 1929, still languished below 150 in 1939. Worst of all, the world was poised for war.</p>
<p class="indent">In short, it was the perfect time for a twentysomething Southerner with almost no experience in the markets to demonstrate that he was the smartest, most coolheaded investor of his generation.</p>
<h2 class="h2x">The Bet of a Century</h2>
<p class="noindent">In September 1939, Germany invaded Poland. Over the next few months, Norway, Holland, and Belgium surrendered to the Nazis. In May 1940, when Germany invaded France, the Dow sank to a new low of 112. The UK stock market crashed about 40 percent in less than four months amid fears of an imminent German invasion of the British Isles. Winston Churchill would later describe 1940 as “the most splendid, most deadly year in our long English and British story.”</p>
<p class="indent">When the world is teetering over the edge of the abyss, how should a savvy investor respond? Conventional opinion might suggest that this <span aria-label="page 41" id="page_41" role="doc-pagebreak"/>was a prudent time to beat a retreat. With stocks crashing to new lows and panic rampant, surely the appropriate response was to seek safety in more defensive assets such as cash, gold, or land. But Templeton was not conventional.</p>
<p class="indent">After Germany’s invasion of Poland, he realized that the world was plunging inexorably into war and that the United States would ultimately have to fight, too. But his icily logical response set him apart. Templeton told me, “I thought, if there’s any time when every product is in demand, it’s during a war. So I said, ‘If this is going to develop into a world war, which companies will prosper?’ ”</p>
<p class="indent">He concluded that “maybe ninety percent” of American businesses “would have more demand and less competition during a war.” Even the weakest companies were likely to recover as wartime spending surged, reinvigorating the economy and boosting employment. Savaged by the Great Depression, many companies were so close to death that a sudden change in their fortunes would have an outsize impact on their stock price. Reborn, they might well outperform the stocks of healthier companies that weren’t so beaten down. You might call it survival of the <i>unfittest</i>.</p>
<p class="indent">But how best to take advantage of this shrewd insight?</p>
<p class="indent">Templeton opened the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> and identified 104 American companies that had experienced “such a terrible Depression” that their stocks traded at $1 or less. A couple of days later, he called a stockbroker who’d been his boss at Fenner &amp; Beane and asked to invest $100 in each of those companies. “He called me back and said, ‘That’s a very unusual order, but we’re going ahead with it, except we’ve eliminated thirty-seven companies that are already in bankruptcy.’ And I said, ‘Oh, no. Don’t eliminate those. They may recover.’ ”</p>
<p class="indent">It was an astonishingly bold bet. But Templeton was so sure of his judgment that he even convinced his ex-boss to lend him $10,000 to fund the investment.<sup class="sup"><a href="footnotes.xhtml#footnote-047" id="footnote-047-backlink">II</a></sup> The future had never looked so bleak. Yet so much dire news was already priced into the market that Templeton thought the odds were stacked resoundingly in his favor. He recalled, “It was commonsense arithmetic that attracted me.”</p>
<p class="indent"><span aria-label="page 42" id="page_42" role="doc-pagebreak"/>One company that exemplified this arithmetic was Missouri Pacific Railroad, which had been among the world’s largest railroads before going bankrupt in the Depression. In its halcyon days, the company had issued preferred stock that was supposed to pay an annual dividend of $7 per share in perpetuity. But shareholders didn’t receive their dividends after the firm went bust, and the price of the preferred stock collapsed from $100 to around twelve cents per share.</p>
<p class="indent">Psychologically, it’s tough to love a money-losing company that has burned all of its investors. But Templeton said he bought eight hundred shares of Missouri Pacific for $100. <b>Like Buffett and Munger, he had an unemotional appreciation for a mispriced bet that offered an asymmetry between risk and reward.</b> “The potential on the upside was much greater than on the downside,” Templeton explained to me. “Sure, I may lose my hundred dollars. But if I <i>don’t</i> lose my hundred dollars, I might make a lot.”</p>
<p class="indent">He was right. Railroads prospered during the war and the stock rebounded from twelve cents to $5 before he cashed out. His only regret was that he sold too soon. “I was so excited about having any stock I bought go up forty times that I thought that was enough,” he recalled. “It was foolishness.… Within four years thereafter, it went up to $105.”</p>
<p class="indent">Of course, a bet like this relied on so much more than mere mathematics. Mark Mobius, an eminent investor in emerging markets who worked with Templeton for years, once told me that it required “tremendous willpower and strength of personality” for Templeton to buy at the point of maximum pessimism. As Mobius put it, “Everybody else is running out of the burning building.”</p>
<p class="indent">What’s remarkable to me is not just that Templeton had the courage to invest in 104 reviled stocks as the world went to war. It’s that he had the courage to <i>hold</i> them for years even as the drumbeat of disastrous news grew more and more deafening. In December 1941, the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, spurring the United States to join the war. By 1942, Germany had seized control of most of Europe. Despair about the future ran so deep that the markets took a terrible pounding. In April 1942, the Dow slumped to a generational low of 92.</p>
<p class="indent">In his superb book <i>Wealth, War &amp; Wisdom</i>, Barton Biggs points <span aria-label="page 43" id="page_43" role="doc-pagebreak"/>out that the State of New York Insurance Commission actually banned stocks from the portfolios of insurance companies in 1942, deeming them an “inappropriate investment.” At the time, writes Biggs, “Every right-thinking prognosticator with a head on his shoulders was bearish.”</p>
<p class="indent">Yet Templeton stood firm. “I had enough self-confidence to think that most of the people called experts were making big mistakes,” he told me. He was also sustained by his religious faith, which enabled him to trust that the world would eventually emerge from chaos. Even in the worst of times, he said, “I never was depressed or despairing.”</p>
<p class="indent">The heavens smiled kindly upon him. In the spring of 1942, the market stopped falling and took flight as the Allies’ fortunes improved and the US economy revived. Templeton’s stocks, once spurned, now soared. After five tempestuous years, he finally sold. “When I liquidated those holdings, I had a profit on one hundred out of one hundred and four,” he said. “I made roughly five times my money.”</p>
<p class="indent">I’ve come to regard Templeton’s wartime bet as one of the boldest and most prescient investments in history—a triumph of both intellect and character. Despite his inexperience, he understood enough about economic history, financial markets, and human nature to recognize that overwhelming pessimism would eventually give way to unbridled optimism. Even in the darkest of times, he never forgot that the sun also rises.</p>
<h2 class="h2x">Six Guiding Principles for the Nontribal Investor</h2>
<p class="noindent">After we chatted in his office for a couple of hours, Templeton drove me to his home. It was a stately building with white columns designed in the style of an antebellum house in the South. With a view of the ocean and a golf course, it felt quiet and peaceful. He often said that his investment performance improved after moving here because the location strengthened his psychological detachment from the Wall Street herd. In his early years here, the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> often arrived days late. For a long-term investor, this could be an unexpected advantage.</p>
<p class="indent">The house was furnished with old-fashioned charm. The living room had a wooden rocking chair, silver candlesticks, and leather<span aria-label="page 44" id="page_44" role="doc-pagebreak"/>bound books such as <i>The Life of Christ</i> and the poetry of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. Upstairs, in his study, Templeton pointed out a painting that depicted him at Buckingham Palace on the day in 1987 when Queen Elizabeth II knighted him for his services to philanthropy. I asked how it felt to receive so many accolades. “It’s like winning a game,” he replied. “I must admit that I’m human. This year I received my twenty-second honorary doctorate, and that did give me some feeling that maybe I was not too foolish.”</p>
<p class="indent">We sat down in his living room. Templeton sipped tea out of a mug emblazoned with the FBI’s motto: Fidelity, Bravery, Integrity. He then shared with me what he saw as the most important lessons of his investment career. During this conversation and a follow-up phone interview, he mentioned six guiding principles that he believed would help any investor.</p>
<p class="indent">This wisdom was the fruit of more than sixty years of practical experience and contemplation by one of the greatest minds of the investment world. It’s worth noting that none of these principles was cloned. When I asked Templeton if anyone had influenced him either as an investor or in other areas of life, he replied, “Absolutely no one.… I didn’t find anyone that I wanted to rely on.” What about his parents? “Not that either.”</p>
<p class="indent"><b>First of all, said Templeton, beware of emotion: “Most people get led astray by emotions in investing. They get led astray by being excessively careless and optimistic when they have big profits, and by getting excessively pessimistic and too cautious when they have big losses.”</b> One of the primary services he provided as a money manager was to help his clients “get away from that emotionalism. It was a major element in my success.”</p>
<p class="indent">But he didn’t just avoid the pitfalls of emotion. He exploited the wayward emotions of <i>other</i> investors, buying from them when they were irrationally bearish and selling to them when they were irrationally bullish. “To buy when others are despondently selling and to sell when others are enthusiastically buying is the most difficult,” he said. “But it pays the greatest rewards.”</p>
<p class="indent">It came naturally for Templeton to approach every decision analytically, whether it was choosing a profession, picking a stock, or deciding <span aria-label="page 45" id="page_45" role="doc-pagebreak"/>where to live. Before moving to Lyford Cay, he took several sheets of paper, wrote a different place name at the top of each sheet, then listed every advantage of that place. Describing this process, he said emphatically, “It was <i>not</i> emotional.”</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Second, said Templeton, beware of your own ignorance, which is “probably an even bigger problem than emotion.… So many people buy something with the tiniest amount of information. They don’t really understand what it is that they’re buying.”</b> It pays to remember the simple fact that there are two sides in every investment transaction: “The one with the greatest information is likely to come out ahead. It takes a huge amount of work and study and investigation.”</p>
<p class="indent">Templeton claimed that diligence had played a much greater role in his success than innate talent. He often spoke of his determination to “give the extra ounce”—to make the extra call, to schedule the extra meeting, to take the extra research trip. He was similarly dedicated to his lifelong program of continuous self-education. As a young man, he said, “I searched for anything available in writing on the subject of investing, and I still do.” Even in his eighties, he said, “I try to be more knowledgeable each year as an investor.”</p>
<p class="indent">Templeton argued that amateurs and professionals alike must avoid fooling themselves into believing that it’s easy to build a strong investment record: “Even with the professionals, not many of them turn out to produce superior results. So the way to invest is to say to yourself, ‘Do I have more experience and wisdom than the professionals?’ And if you don’t, then <i>don’t</i> do it. Hire a professional.… Don’t be so egotistical that you think you’ll do better than the experts.”</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Third, said Templeton, you should diversify broadly to protect yourself from your own fallibility.</b> By his calculation, he had made at least half a million investment decisions in his career. For many years, he kept a detailed record of the advice he’d given to clients on which stocks to buy or sell. This revealed an uncomfortable truth: about a third of his advice was “the opposite of wisdom.” Investing is so difficult, he concluded, that even the best investors should assume that they’ll be right no more than two-thirds of the time, however hard they work.</p>
<p class="indent">The moral? Get your ego—and your risk exposure—under control. “Don’t put all your money with any one expert. Don’t put all your <span aria-label="page 46" id="page_46" role="doc-pagebreak"/>money in any one industry or any one nation. Nobody is that smart. So the wise thing is to diversify.” Templeton recommended that the average investor should own a minimum of five mutual funds, each focused on a different area of the financial markets. It’s helpful to study a fund manager’s long-term record, he added, but this is hardly a guarantee of continued success. Again, we need to be honest about the limits of our knowledge: “Don’t be so egotistical that you think you know who is the right expert.”</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Fourth, said Templeton, successful investing requires patience.</b> When he bought US stocks at the outbreak of World War II, he knew how cheap they were, but he couldn’t predict how long it would take for the market to agree with him. His edge lay not just in his superior insight, but in his willingness to wait year after painful year for the situation to play out as he’d predicted.</p>
<p class="indent">Templeton’s affection for math reinforced his conviction that patience pays. To illustrate this, he mentioned the tale of Dutch immigrants buying Manhattan for $24 in 1626.<sup class="sup"><a href="footnotes.xhtml#footnote-046" id="footnote-046-backlink">III</a></sup> If the Native American sellers had invested this derisory sum at 8 percent a year, he said, they would have “enormously more than the total value of Manhattan today, including all the buildings.” Templeton regarded this as an extreme example of a fundamental financial principle: “In order to have a really good investment result, all you need is patience.” He warned that “almost all” investors are “too impatient,” adding, “People who change from one fund to another as often as once a year are basing it more on emotion than investigation.”</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Fifth, said Templeton, the best way to find bargains is to study whichever assets have performed most dismally in the past five years, then to assess whether the cause of those woes is temporary or permanent.</b> Most people are naturally drawn to investments that are already successful and popular with the herd, whether it’s a high-flying stock or fund or a rapidly growing country. But if a sunny future is already reflected in the price of the asset, then it’s probably a bet for suckers.</p>
<p class="indent"><span aria-label="page 47" id="page_47" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Templeton, the least tribal of investors, took the opposite approach. He wanted to know “Where is the outlook <i>worst</i>?” These pockets of gloom were likely to yield the most enticing bargains, since asset prices would reflect the tribe’s pessimism. His contrarian strategy involved scrutinizing stocks in beleaguered industries and markets around the world, constantly asking himself, “Which one is the lowest priced compared to what I believe it’s worth?”</p>
<p class="indent">At the time of our discussions, the Asian financial crisis of 1997 had left a trail of destruction in countries such as Thailand, Indonesia, and South Korea. If you wanted to identify the most battered investment vehicle on earth, one clear contender was the Matthews Korea Fund, which lost about 65 percent in 1997. The fund had the misfortune of investing solely in a nation traumatized by a lending freeze, a collapsing currency, and deadly levels of corporate leverage.</p>
<p class="indent">Templeton decided in late 1997 that South Korean stocks were the cheapest in the world relative to future corporate earnings. The price/earnings ratio of Korean stocks had crashed from more than 20 in June 1997 to 10 in December—a rough but revealing measure of investors’ fear and loathing. Still, it was reasonable to assume that the country’s history of powerful economic growth would eventually resume, once this vicious liquidity crisis had passed. So Templeton poured $10 million into the Matthews Korea Fund, becoming its single largest shareholder. He told me, “It could hardly get any worse from a psychological and public relations standpoint.”</p>
<p class="indent">To the typical investor, that might not sound like a rousing endorsement. But just think for a moment about the simple elegance of his logic and the independence of mind required to wade into the South Korean market while everyone else flooded out. Sure enough, the crisis proved to be fleeting, just as he’d surmised. In June 1999, Bloomberg News reported that the Matthews Korea Fund had risen 266 percent in the past year, making it the single best performer in its ranking of 5,307 stock funds. As the Bible says, “The last shall be first, and the first last.”</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Sixth, said Templeton, “One of the most important things as an investor is not to chase fads.”</b> In the 1980s, the Templeton Foundation Press republished a timeless book with a magnificent title: <i>Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds</i>. Written in 1841 by <span aria-label="page 48" id="page_48" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Charles Mackay, it tells the history of crazes such as tulip mania and the South Sea Bubble. Templeton wrote a foreword that offered a rational antidote to financial insanity: “The best way for an investor to avoid popular delusions is to focus not on outlook but on value.”</p>
<p class="indent">He suggested that we ground ourselves in reality by investigating an array of specific valuation measures, including a company’s market price in relation to its sales volume per share, its net asset value per share, and its average earnings per share for the last five years. This “critical analysis” of an “investment’s fundamental value” acts as a safeguard against “crowd madness.”</p>
<p class="indent">At the time of our meeting, US stocks had enjoyed an eight-year bull run and euphoric investors were betting blindly on technology and internet stocks. It seemed clear to me that we were in the midst of a mania, but I wanted Templeton to confirm what I suspected. He didn’t make it easy.</p>
<p class="indent">Early in our conversation, he had told me, “The point of maximum optimism is the time to take your profits.” But when I asked him repeatedly if we’d reached that point, he evaded the question. Finally, he snapped, “Anybody is <i>stupid</i> to ask that question. Is that clear? Nobody ever knows when the point comes.… Some experts are right a little more often than <i>you</i> might be. But still, it’s a human failing to even put your mind on a question of which stock market is going to go up or down. There’s never been anybody who knew that.”</p>
<p class="indent">I felt like I’d been smacked around the head. I understood his broader point that making market predictions is a mug’s game. But he knew as well as anyone that many US stocks were poised for pain because their valuations were unsustainable. It was impossible to predict <i>when</i> the music would stop, but the outcome was pretty predictable. In retrospect, I suspect he was mad at me for not taking sufficient interest in his philanthropic work, which he insisted was “the real story.” Note to self: think twice before asking a revered icon if many people think he’s “a kook.”</p>
<p class="indent">In any case, it later emerged that Templeton hatched an inspired scheme to profit when the dot-com bubble burst. Here’s how it worked.</p>
<p class="indent">Back then, unscrupulous investment banks were making a killing by taking internet companies public. The Wall Street sales machine <span aria-label="page 49" id="page_49" role="doc-pagebreak"/>moved into overdrive, hyping and hawking any half-credible rubbish that naive, greedy, or reckless investors might be willing to buy. It was a classic outbreak of investment insanity—loads of fun until someone loses an eye. Templeton knew that this tragicomedy would end in tears. After all, he had often cautioned that the four most expensive words in the English language are “This time is different.”</p>
<p class="indent">His response was to target eighty-four of the most egregiously overvalued internet stocks, all of which had tripled since their initial public offering. After the IPO, a “lockup” period followed in which company employees weren’t allowed to sell their shares, typically for six months. Templeton reasoned that these insiders would race to dump their stock at the first opportunity since they’d be anxious to cash out before the euphoria faded. This stampede of insider selling would cause the stocks to crash.</p>
<p class="indent">So Templeton “sold short” each of those eighty-four stocks, betting that they’d nose-dive as soon as the lockup period expired. Lauren Templeton, a money manager who is his great-niece, has said that he placed a $2.2 million bet against each stock—a total of about $185 million.</p>
<p class="indent">Templeton’s short-selling strategy worked like a dream. When the dot-com bubble burst in March 2000, he earned a profit of more than $90 million in months. Years later, when the <i>Economist</i> ran an article about the greatest financial trades of all time, it declared that his “ingenious” scheme “wins the ‘Wish I’d thought of that’ prize by a mile.”</p>
<p class="indent">It fills me with wonder that a man in his late eighties conjured up this glorious gambit. Best of all, there was an exquisite symmetry at play here. In 1939, he realized that the investment crowd had fallen for the illusion that the future offered nothing but misery and loss. In 1999, he realized that the investment crowd had fallen for the illusion that the future offered nothing but pleasure and profit. On both occasions, he trusted his superior judgment. In 1939, he bought a basket of stocks that the crowd hated. In 1999, he shorted a basket of stocks that the crowd adored. Two masterful investments, the mirror image of each other, separated by six decades.</p>
<h2 class="h2x"><span aria-label="page 50" id="page_50" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Master of His Domain</h2>
<p class="noindent">Before we go any further, let me make a confession. The truth is, I didn’t really like Sir John Templeton. Sure, I was excited to meet him, and I was grateful for his time. But I saw in him a cold austerity that I found unnerving.</p>
<p class="indent">In his book <i>Wisdom from World Religions: Pathways Toward Heaven on Earth</i>, he wrote at length about virtues such as “unlimited love,” forgiveness, humility, and compassion. But the warm and generous side of his nature coexisted with a side that could seem stern and severe. He was kind enough to drive me to the airport so that I could continue interviewing him in his car. But after he left, I wrote a note to myself that captured my ambivalence about him: “He’s curiously dry, steely, formal. Charming but tough. Incredibly strong-willed. He claims to be open and listening, but he’s dogmatic and extreme.”</p>
<p class="indent">In <i>The Templeton Touch</i>, a biography by William Proctor, one of the most perceptive reminiscences comes from Rory Knight, the former dean of Templeton College, Oxford, which Templeton helped to fund. “He was a hard guy,” Knight recalls. “He was not a soft man walking around as a seminarian just being nice to people. Now, he was never rude to people and he was an absolute gentleman.… I would say, though, that he was demanding of people at all times in the best sense of that word. He brought out the best in people, and set a hard expectation.”</p>
<p class="indent">To his credit, Templeton was especially demanding of himself. Take his attitude toward saving and spending. “After my education, I had absolutely no money and neither did my bride,” he told me. “So we deliberately saved fifty cents out of every dollar we earned.” But he had no intention of relaxing his financial discipline even when he was astronomically rich. While many of his peers favored private jets, he always insisted on flying coach. “I’ve got a lot better ways to spend my money than to waste it by getting a bigger seat,” he explained. “I never thought it was wise to waste anything.”</p>
<p class="indent">When Templeton was a famous fund manager, his employees would chuckle about his habit of writing on scraps of used paper, which he <span aria-label="page 51" id="page_51" role="doc-pagebreak"/>stapled together to create makeshift notepads. Late in life, he relished saving money by driving an inexpensive Kia car from South Korea. Gary Moore, a friend of his who served as an adviser to religious investors, joked to me, “John is what we call a Calvinist. He believes it’s okay to make money so long as you don’t enjoy it.” Given his compulsive cheapness, it’s no surprise that Templeton specialized in buying undervalued stocks.</p>
<p class="indent">Distrustful of debt, he always paid cash for his cars and homes. He also claimed that his wartime bet was the only time he ever borrowed money to invest. During the Great Depression he’d seen how easy it was for overextended people to come undone, and he regarded fiscal discipline as a moral virtue. As we were leaving his office, a stranger accosted him in the parking lot and asked for money to pay an electricity bill. Templeton handed him $50 in return for a promise that the man would never again ask him for money. In the car, he explained why this was his standard operating procedure: “The type of person who runs out of money will keep on running out of money. And if he got it somewhere, he’ll keep on going back there.”</p>
<p class="indent">Templeton’s watchfulness over money also stemmed from his belief that we are merely “temporary stewards” of God’s wealth. He liked to begin meetings at his fund company with a prayer, and he saw a strong connection between spirituality and material success. “If you focus on spiritual matters, you will very likely become wealthy,” he told me. “I never found a family that tithed ten percent of their income to charity for ten years that didn’t become both prosperous and happy. So tithing is the single best investment in the world.” He had even developed “a new form” of “super” tithing: “For every dollar I spend on myself, I carefully give away ten dollars.”</p>
<p class="indent">He was equally exacting in his approach to time management. John Galbraith, who marketed Templeton’s funds, recalled, “John won’t engage in small talk. The minute you’re through with your common business, he’s on to something else.” Gary Moore added, “The first time I met John, he said, ‘Be here at 4:02. I’ve got another appointment at 4:13.”</p>
<p class="indent">Determined not to squander a minute, Templeton made a habit of doing two things at once. During our meeting in his house, he under<span aria-label="page 52" id="page_52" role="doc-pagebreak"/>lined key passages in a book for me while simultaneously answering my questions. He also liked to multitask by praying as he drove. Obsessed with punctuality, he routinely arrived ten minutes early for meetings. He abhorred procrastination. He disapproved of distractions such as television and movies (especially “unprincipled entertainment”), preferring to read corporate filings or “inspirational” books. He referred to “goofing off” as “a form of theft” and to idleness as “a form of slow suicide.”</p>
<p class="indent">When I remarked that he seemed hard on himself, he replied, “Let’s call it self-control. I do think that I’ve always worked on having more self-control, and I sure wish other people would.”</p>
<p class="indent">It wasn’t just his money and his time that he managed with fierce self-discipline. He was also fixated on managing his mind. In <i>Wisdom from World Religions</i>, he returned over and over to the subject of “thought control.” In his daily life, he trained himself to focus on “productive thoughts” and “positive emotions” such as love, thanksgiving, service, and the contemplation of “the infinite good within ourselves and others.”</p>
<p class="indent">Templeton was equally committed to banishing negative thoughts and emotions such as anger, doubt, worry, guilt, fear, hatred, and envy. One technique that he recommended was to replace any negative thought with the statement “I give thanks for the abundance of good in my life.” When faced with difficulties, he suggested uttering a phrase such as “This comes to bless me.” He also sought to eradicate any “aimless, undisciplined thinking” that failed to serve the “high aims” of his life. As Templeton put it, we have immense power to shape our lives by choosing “where we wish to place our focus, for <i>what we focus on expands</i>.”<sup class="sup"><a href="footnotes.xhtml#footnote-045" id="footnote-045-backlink">IV</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Templeton’s determination to rule his mind helped him to endure some terrible times. In 1951, he and his first wife, Judith, were on vacation in Bermuda when she died in a motorcycle accident. As a thirty-eight-year-old widower, he suddenly found himself responsible <span aria-label="page 53" id="page_53" role="doc-pagebreak"/>for raising their three children alone. He made it through those years by “crowding out” the wrenching thoughts that might otherwise have overwhelmed his mind. In 1958, he married his second wife, Irene, a Christian Scientist who shared his belief in the power of the mind and prayer.</p>
<p class="indent">As a skeptical journalist, my tendency in those days (not now) was to roll my eyes at the mention of “positive thinking” and “thought control.” I was so closed-minded that I also gave no serious consideration to Templeton’s mission of exploring scientifically whether spiritual practices such as prayer or forgiveness might be beneficial. I’m embarrassed to admit it, but my prejudices made me smug and dismissive. Instead, I should have suspended judgment until I learned more.</p>
<p class="indent">What I realize now is that Templeton’s habits of positive thinking and prayer must have helped enormously in his battle to gain control over his thoughts and emotions. For an investor who specialized in taking unpopular positions, that mental strength was a powerful advantage.</p>
<p class="indent">By contrast, my own mind was hopelessly undirected, and it was easy for me to get swamped by feelings such as fear, doubt, regret, greed, impatience, jealousy, and pessimism—all of which complicate the challenge of making rational investment decisions.</p>
<p class="indent">In <i>Wisdom from World Religions</i>, Templeton wrote, “To live successfully in the outer world, it is important to live successfully in the inner world.… The friends, associates, opportunities, careers, and life experiences of our outer world are reflections of what is happening within us.” Templeton took control of his inner world. At the time, he struck me as judgmental and holier-than-thou, which made me less open to learning from him. But twenty years later, I find myself awed by his inner strength and iron will, and I wish that I had half of his self-control.</p>
<p class="indent">As I see it now, Templeton didn’t just master the markets. <i>He mastered himself</i>. He took responsibility for every aspect of his life, including his time, money, health, thoughts, and emotions. This required extraordinary self-discipline. We don’t often celebrate self-discipline. It’s such an old-fashioned and fusty virtue. But Templeton triumphed by taking self-discipline to an extreme. As Pabrai learned from Munger, “Take a simple idea and take it seriously.”</p>
<p class="indent">There’s so much in investing and life that we <i>cannot</i> control. Temple<span aria-label="page 54" id="page_54" role="doc-pagebreak"/>ton couldn’t be sure that the Allies would prevail in World War II. He could never have predicted that his first wife would die young. But he controlled what he <i>could</i> control.</p>
<p class="indent">As an investor, that meant focusing with remorseless discipline on valuations, on gathering better information than his rivals possessed, on making fearlessly independent judgments with no concern for the tastes of the tribe. It also meant doing everything in his power to maintain his mental and emotional equilibrium. He couldn’t control the outcome, but he could control himself. What I failed to learn from Templeton two decades ago is the supreme importance of this inner game.</p>
