<p class="noindent">Nick Sleep dreamed of becoming a landscape architect. He envisioned himself designing parks and public spaces that offered a refuge from the hurly-burly of life. So, after graduating from Edinburgh University, he took a landscaping apprenticeship at a local firm. “My romantic notion of what working there might be was completely shattered by the reality, which was that we were working on dormer windows and car parks,” he says. A few months later, he was laid off. “The staff went <span aria-label="page 140" id="page_140" role="doc-pagebreak"/>from thirty to twenty.… And I was one of the ten that was kicked out.”</p>
<p class="indent">Sleep, who is English, wanted to stay in Edinburgh, since he and his future wife, Serita, had bought a small apartment in the city’s suburbs. “So I just looked around to see what Edinburgh was good at,” he says. A career in information technology seemed like a viable option. But he also learned that Edinburgh had a reputation for fund management. He read an obscure book titled <i>Investment Trusts Explained</i> to help him figure out what the investing business was all about. He came away intrigued: “I liked that sense of it being an intellectual investigation.”</p>
<p class="indent">Sleep landed a job as a trainee investment analyst at a small Scottish fund company. He was not abundantly qualified for the job. At college, he had studied geology and then switched to geography—hardly the standard preparation for a stock-picking career. His employment history offered no evidence that he had yearned since birth for a career in finance. He had worked in the Harrods department store, temped at an IT firm, and secured a sponsorship deal for windsurfing. With his movie-star looks and soft-spoken charm, he didn’t fit the mold of a corporate drone.</p>
<p class="indent">Still, as luck would have it, he had stumbled into a field that perfectly suited his idiosyncratic mind. Like all of the best investors, Sleep views the world from an unusual angle. He suspects this stems from his formative experience as a teenager at Wellington College, an English boarding school founded by Queen Victoria. Sleep was one of the few students who lived at home, which meant that he “floated free” on the periphery of school life. He even worked in a pub on weekends, while most of his classmates stayed on their four-hundred-acre campus. “I got comfortable with being different from everyone else early on,” he says. “I was happy being outside the group.”</p>
<p class="indent">When Sleep was about twenty, he fell under the spell of Robert Pirsig’s <i>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance: An Inquiry into Values</i>. This memoir-as-tutorial, which had been rejected by 121 publishers, is a strange but brilliant meditation on what it means to lead a life dedicated to “Quality.” Pirsig exalts people who care so intensely about the quality of their actions and decisions that even the most mundane work becomes a spiritual exercise—a reflection of inner traits such as patience, integrity, rationality, and serenity. Whether you’re mending <span aria-label="page 141" id="page_141" role="doc-pagebreak"/>a chair, sewing a dress, or sharpening a kitchen knife, he writes that there is “an ugly way of doing it” and “a high-quality, beautiful way of doing it.”</p>
<p class="indent">For Pirsig, motorcycle maintenance provides an ideal metaphor for how to live and work in a transcendent way. “The real cycle you’re working on is a cycle called yourself,” he writes. “The machine that appears to be ‘out there’ and the person that appears to be ‘in here’ are not two separate things. They grow toward Quality or fall away from Quality together.”</p>
<p class="indent">As you might imagine, most of the hyper-ambitious strivers on Wall Street don’t have a lot of patience for mystical mumbo jumbo about motorcycles. But Pirsig’s vision of a soulful, ethical, intellectually honest approach to life resonated deeply with Sleep and shaped the type of investor he would become. In an email about Pirsig’s enduring impact on him, Sleep remarks, “You really want to do everything with quality as that is where the satisfaction and peace is.”</p>
<p class="indent">But what does this mean when it comes to investing? In 2001, Sleep and his friend Qais “Zak” Zakaria created a fund called the Nomad Investment Partnership, which they viewed as a laboratory test for how to invest, think, and behave in the most “high-quality” way. In one of his eloquent and amusing letters to shareholders, Sleep would muse, “Nomad means far more to us than simply managing a fund.… Nomad is a rational, metaphysical, almost spiritual journey (without the sand and camels, although Zak may be happier with them).”</p>
<p class="indent">None of this would matter if it weren’t for the stunning outcome of their peculiarly high-minded experiment. Over thirteen years, Nomad returned 921.1 percent versus 116.9 percent for the MSCI World Index.<sup class="sup"><a href="footnotes.xhtml#footnote-017" id="footnote-017-backlink">I</a></sup> In other words, their fund beat its benchmark index by more than <i>800 percentage points</i>. To put that another way, $1 million invested in the index would have grown to $2.17 million, while $1 million invested in Nomad rocketed to $10.21 million.</p>
<p class="indent">In 2014, Sleep and Zakaria returned their shareholders’ money <span aria-label="page 142" id="page_142" role="doc-pagebreak"/>and retired as fund managers at the ripe old age of forty-five. Since then, they’ve managed their own money with equally striking success, approximately tripling their wealth in their first five years of retirement. Sleep, with characteristic indifference to conventional opinion, invested almost all of his fortune in just three stocks. At times, he and Zakaria have had as much as 70 percent of their money in a single stock.</p>
<p class="indent">Among the cognoscenti, few other investors are held in such high esteem. Bill Miller, who says he admires the “complete independence” and “clarity of their thinking,” invested his own money in Nomad. Guy Spier, who is friends with Sleep, reveres him as one of the most profound thinkers in the investment world. When I asked Mohnish Pabrai for advice about which investors to interview, he told me, “Nick Sleep is exceptional. He does very deep research and has very high concentration. That’s a lot of putting your nuts on the line.… He would be a fascinating interview, but he won’t do it. He’s a very private person.”</p>
<p class="indent">Indeed, part of their mystique lies in the fact that Sleep and Zakaria have always flown under the radar. They had minimal interest in marketing their fund and even less interest in self-promotion. As a result, their story has never been told. But over the last few years, I’ve interviewed Sleep on multiple occasions. Then, in the fall of 2018, I spent an afternoon with him and Zakaria at their office on the King’s Road in London—a bright and cheery space, which is so informal that Zakaria doesn’t even have a desk. He prefers to work in a plush leather armchair, which faces a wall where their matching beekeeper suits hang together from hooks. It was there—in “Galactic HQ”—that they reflected on what they call their “adventures in capitalism.”</p>
<p class="indent">What emerged from our conversations is a heartening morality tale in which the good guys win. It’s also a story about the extraordinary advantages that accrue to investors with the discipline and patience to resist the temptations of instant gratification. In a high-speed era dominated by short-term thinking, this capacity to defer rewards is one of the most powerful contributors to success, not only in markets, but in business and life.</p>
<h2 class="h2x"><span aria-label="page 143" id="page_143" role="doc-pagebreak"/>A House Built on Sand</h2>
<p class="noindent">Zakaria, like Sleep, never dreamed of working on Wall Street. “To be honest, I would have loved to have done something else,” he says. “I would have been a meteorologist if my parents had let me. I found it fascinating. I used to read weather reports and do my own weather reports, and my parents thought it was stupid.”</p>
<p class="indent">Born in Iraq in 1969, he came from a relatively privileged family. His father worked for the Iraqi central bank. His mother lectured on nutrition at the University of Baghdad. But it was a perilous time, rife with political intrigue and violence. “We were purged,” says Zakaria. His family fled, leaving everything behind. In 1972, a Catholic charity helped his parents find refuge in the UK, where they would raise their three children. “They pitched up here with nothing,” says Zakaria. “Literally nothing except an orange Volvo, which they’d been given by someone in Turkey.”</p>
<p class="indent">His father knocked on doors until he found a job as a junior accountant. He worked his way up, then started a successful business exporting machinery to Iraq. Zakaria’s parents expected him to join the firm and eventually run it, helping to expand their cushion against the uncertainties of life. “Money is very important to them,” he says. “The accumulation of money. Not necessarily spending it. It’s about security and status.” In 1987, Zakaria headed to Cambridge University to study mathematics. Everything seemed on track. But that same year, his father went bankrupt.</p>
<p class="indent">It turned out that he’d speculated in the stock market using borrowed money. He had traded hot stocks touted in dubious tip sheets and had fallen for pyramid schemes pitched by sleazy salesmen. One stockbroker “would recommend a stock based on this pyramid of who was in first and who was in last,” says Zakaria. “The more money you put in, the higher you got in the pyramid. My father never got high enough, and when it all collapsed, he lost everything.” The family was deluged with debt and the export business died.</p>
<p class="indent">For Zakaria, it was a sickening introduction to the investment business. “My father had made his money on things he understood and lost <span aria-label="page 144" id="page_144" role="doc-pagebreak"/>it on things he didn’t understand, and he was taken to the cleaners by very unscrupulous people.” These memories left Zakaria with a permanent suspicion of salespeople, get-rich-quick schemes, and the “casino” aspect of Wall Street.</p>
<p class="indent">After graduating from Cambridge in 1990, Zakaria entered the investing game largely by default. The family business was no longer an option. Unlike his siblings, he couldn’t become a doctor because he faints at the sight of blood. And meteorology is stupid. So he took a job in Hong Kong as an equity analyst at Jardine Fleming, one of Asia’s leading asset managers. It went well enough until 1996. Then his boss, a hotshot fund manager, was accused of allocating successful trades to his own account, allegedly depriving clients of profits that should have been allocated to <i>their</i> accounts. The fund manager was fired and fined millions of dollars. But with the firm’s reputation in tatters, the business had to be restructured. Zakaria was laid off.</p>
<p class="indent">“I rang round a couple of friends and said, ‘Do you have anything? I’ll literally do <i>anything</i>.’ ” A friend who ran a stockbroking desk at Deutsche Bank took mercy and gave him a job as a “sell-side” analyst specializing in Asian stocks. It was one of life’s cruel cosmic jokes. Zakaria, with his distrust for salespeople in general and stockbrokers in particular, would earn his keep by hawking stock tips to the bank’s institutional clients. “I did it for four years, and it was absolute hell,” he says. “Not being someone who is easily sold to, I couldn’t sell to anyone.”</p>
<p class="indent">His time at Deutsche provided Zakaria with a crash course in the ways of Wall Street. “It was a shocking place to work,” he says. Moral compromises went with the territory. “My good friend and boss there said, ‘You must never persuade someone not to do what they want to do, even if you think it’s wrong. Just let them do it because you’ll never be thanked.’ And I thought, ‘That’s a terrible way to live.’ It’s awful! I mean, if you think they’re making a mistake, you should <i>tell</i> them.” Zakaria says he was so ill-suited to the job that he’d have been fired within a month if his boss hadn’t “shielded” him. Still, there was one consolation. He met Nick Sleep.</p>
<p class="indent">After three years in his first investing job back in Edinburgh, Sleep had become an investment analyst at Sun Life of Canada, a financial services giant with tens of thousands of employees. “I was almost allergic to <span aria-label="page 145" id="page_145" role="doc-pagebreak"/>working there,” he says. “Once you’ve worked for a feisty company, it’s quite difficult to go work for something big, dull, and boring.” He quit after a few months and landed in 1995 at Marathon Asset Management, where he would stay for more than a decade. It was a scrappy, high-flying investment firm in London that was “trying to outbox the big guys.”</p>
<p class="indent">Sleep’s mentor there was one of Marathon’s cofounders, Jeremy Hosking, an English eccentric whose hobbies include collecting vintage steam engines. “He’s naturally iconoclastic,” says Sleep. “His bias is to buy just about the most despised thing he can find.… He likes the controversy, the difficulty.” When the Asian financial crisis struck in 1997, Hosking and Sleep went scavenging for cheap stocks in the smoldering markets of Southeast Asia. Everyone else seemed to be running for cover as Asia’s economic miracle turned to disaster. But the Marathon Men found an unlikely ally in an Asia-based broker who wasn’t like everyone else: Zakaria.</p>
<p class="indent">Sleep and Zakaria talked regularly about the crazy bargains they were unearthing in places like Singapore, Hong Kong, and the Philippines. Most brokers focused on popular assets that were easy to sell. But Zakaria was excited by reviled stocks trading at fabulous discounts. “Zak was a rubbish stockbroker because what would appeal to him would appeal to us and would appeal to nobody else,” says Sleep. “So it had no commercial value. You couldn’t sell it to anybody else.” But Zakaria’s eye for discarded jewels was precisely what made him valuable to Marathon. Hosking told him, “When you can’t sell a stock to anyone else, call us.”</p>
<p class="indent">During the miracle years, investors had been so bullish about Asia that they had bet on stocks trading at three times the replacement cost of their assets. During the crisis, you could buy those same stocks for <i>one-quarter</i> of the replacement cost of their assets. In less than a year, Marathon invested about $500 million in Southeast Asia and made a killing as the region rebounded. Part of the credit went to Zakaria. “He was exactly the analyst we needed in the Asian crisis,” says Sleep. “He was just a salesperson working for an investment bank, but he wasn’t really doing a salesperson’s job because he wasn’t selling what they wanted him to sell.” This sense that Zakaria was swimming (somewhat desperately) against the tide was about to intensify.</p>
<p class="indent"><span aria-label="page 146" id="page_146" role="doc-pagebreak"/>If you were a satirical novelist looking to write about Wall Street at its worst, you might choose a golden age of greed such as late 1999 and early 2000. It was a time when the mania for tech and internet stocks mangled the minds of bankers, brokers, fund managers, and regular investors. Millions of people were consumed by a desire for instant riches, and their only apparent fear was the fear of missing out.</p>
<p class="indent">Deutsche and its rivals profited handsomely by taking half-baked companies public at inflated valuations, ignoring whatever doubts they may have harbored about whether these businesses would endure. Research analysts at supposedly reputable brokerages acted as shameless stock promoters.<sup class="sup"><a href="footnotes.xhtml#footnote-016" id="footnote-016-backlink">II</a></sup> And brokers like Zakaria felt obliged to sell this dreck to investors who either knew no better or dreamed of getting rich before the frenzy faded. This was the ultimate casino. Yet Zakaria refused to play. “The IPOs were all absolutely awful, and I’d <i>tell</i> people they were awful. And, of course, you wouldn’t sell any, and it was all very miserable.”</p>
<p class="indent">One deal etched forever in his mind involved a Taiwanese tech start-up, GigaMedia Ltd. It was less than two years old and profits were nothing but a distant dream. Undeterred, Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank decided to take it public on Nasdaq in February 2000 at the peak of the bubble. Zakaria says one of his colleagues—“your archetypal perfect salesperson”—phoned a fund manager in Paris and told him, “I think you should buy it.” The fund manager placed a $150 million order. There was just one problem. This exceeded the total assets in his fund. Still, nobody seemed to care, since it was all a game. The fund manager was betting that the bank would grant him a fraction of the shares he requested and that the stock would surge.</p>
<p class="indent">Lo and behold, GigaMedia’s stock shot up from $27 to $88 on the day of the IPO, giving this money-losing minnow a valuation of more <span aria-label="page 147" id="page_147" role="doc-pagebreak"/>than $4 billion. But it was all an illusion. When the dot-com bubble burst a few weeks later, GigaMedia lost 98 percent of its value.</p>
<p class="indent">For Zakaria, it was all too much—the irrationality, the lack of substance, the willingness to do whatever it took to make a quick buck regardless of who got hurt. “I suffer from anxiety, and I needed something that was more grounded,” he says. “My time at Deutsche Bank was just so bad for me healthwise because there’s nothing grounded in being a stockbroker. You turn up in the morning and you have no idea how your day is going to develop, whether your client is going to like you or hate you, or whether you’re going to be sacked or not. It was all so unstable.”</p>
<p class="indent">He was rescued by Marathon. In April 2000, when the dot-com darlings were getting smashed to pieces, Zakaria escaped from Deutsche to work with Sleep as an analyst at Marathon’s office in London. In May, they traveled together to Omaha for Berkshire Hathaway’s annual meeting. “It was wonderful,” says Zakaria. Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger spoke about companies they expected to own for decades. They weren’t rolling the dice on the latest idiotic IPO or scheming to line their pockets at other people’s expense. “Oh, my God,” thought Zakaria. “This is nothing to do with a casino! This is about real businesses!”</p>
<p class="indent">Sleep kept nagging his bosses to let him launch a concentrated fund within Marathon, with Buffett serving as his model. Buffett struck him as the embodiment of quality. It wasn’t just the depth of his thinking about businesses, but the honorable way in which he treated Berkshire’s shareholders, beginning with his modest salary of $100,000 a year. At one extreme, says Sleep, “you’ve got Buffett being as principled as you can possibly be.” At the other extreme, “there are marketing-driven companies that happen to be selling investment funds, but could be selling cars or washing machines.… They couldn’t give a toss about their clients.”</p>
<p class="indent">When Sleep’s bosses gave him the green light to start the Nomad Investment Partnership in 2001, he asked Zakaria to join him as comanager of the fund. “It was obvious that we were always going to do something a little bit odd,” says Sleep. Indeed, from the start, they regarded Nomad as an act of rebellion against what he calls “the sin and folly” of the investment industry. “We wanted to prove that there’s <span aria-label="page 148" id="page_148" role="doc-pagebreak"/>another way of investing and another way of behaving,” says Sleep. “You don’t have to go and do all of the Wall Street bollocks.”</p>
<h2 class="h2x">Never Mind the Bollocks<sup class="sup"><a href="footnotes.xhtml#footnote-015" id="footnote-015-backlink">III</a></sup></h2>
<p class="noindent">Sleep and Zakaria had no interest in building a colossal fund that would shower them with fees. They didn’t fantasize about appearing as market gurus on CNBC or being fetishized on the cover of <i>Forbes</i>. They had no desire to buy themselves castles, airplanes, or yachts. Their ambition was simple. They wanted to generate superb long-term returns.</p>
<p class="indent">Specifically, their target was a tenfold increase in Nomad’s net asset value. Sleep, who has three daughters and a godson, framed this mission in somewhat whimsical terms: If they ever asked him, “What did you do during the war?,” he wanted to reply, “We turned one pound into ten pounds.”</p>
<p class="indent">Anyone looking to achieve stellar returns would do well to study what Sleep and Zakaria figured out about where to focus their attention—and, equally important, what they ignored. Sleep cites a line from the philosopher William James: “The art of being wise is the art of knowing what to overlook.” He and Zakaria rejected a slew of standard practices. “We were just getting rid of all the things we didn’t like,” says Sleep. “We were signed-up members of the awkward squad.”</p>
<p class="indent">For a start, they disregarded all of the ephemeral information that distracts investors from what matters. Sleep notes that information, like food, has a “sell-by” date. But some of it is <i>especially</i> perishable, while some has “a long shelf life.” This concept of shelf life became a valuable filter.</p>
<p class="indent"><span aria-label="page 149" id="page_149" role="doc-pagebreak"/>For example, when I spoke with Sleep and Zakaria again in May 2020, the financial news was full of speculation about the near-term impact of the COVID-19 virus on consumer spending, corporate profits, unemployment, interest rates, and asset prices. An article in the <i>Financial Times</i> even debated whether a US economic recovery might resemble the letter <i>V</i>, <i>U</i>, <i>W</i>, <i>L</i>, or a “Nike swoosh.” To Sleep and Zakaria, this fleeting news coverage was all part of the daily “soap opera” of the market—too superficial, short-lived, and unreliable to hold their attention. They couldn’t predict how the economic news would unfold. So why waste mental energy on the unknowable?</p>
<p class="indent">Similarly, they ignored the flood of short-term financial data and recommendations gushing out of Wall Street. Brokerage firms, which have an incentive to spur activity among investors, crank out unreliable estimates of the next quarter’s earnings per share for thousands of companies. Sleep refers dismissively to the “quarterly EPS junkies” who crave this information, which will already be “worthless” in twelve weeks. As he sees it, the “short-term crowd” responds constantly to “false stimuli,” whether it’s the latest economic data point or the trivial news that a company has beaten analysts’ expectations. “You need to be wired not to believe the bullshit, to not be listening.”</p>
<p class="indent">One practical way of extricating themselves from this muck was to discard all of the sell-side research excreted by Wall Street. “We put it in a pile,” says Zakaria. “Every month or so, you start looking through, thinking, ‘I’m bored.’ So the whole lot would go in the bin.… It really was all just gossip and bits of nonsense, and we became very happy with the idea of not hearing it.” Likewise, Sleep and Zakaria told stockbrokers that it was pointless phoning them with sales pitches since they relied on their own research to reach independent conclusions.</p>
<p class="indent">They also disengaged from the day-to-day action of the market by minimizing their use of a Bloomberg terminal. Fund managers often stare interminably at a wall of four monitors flashing real-time data and financial news at them. The Bloomberg, which costs about $24,000 a year to rent, is a status symbol among professional investors. But to this day, Sleep and Zakaria relegate their single Bloomberg monitor to a short side table without a chair. “It was <i>meant</i> to be uncomfortable,” says Zakaria. “Nick wanted it on a low table because you could only <span aria-label="page 150" id="page_150" role="doc-pagebreak"/>spend five minutes without thinking, ‘Oh, my back’s killing me,’ and you move on.”</p>
<p class="indent">Pat Dorsey, a Chicago-based hedge fund manager, expresses a similar view. “The single best thing any investor can do is to not have a TV and a Bloomberg terminal in their office,” he once told me. “That I have to walk fifty feet down the hall to look at stock prices or check the news on our portfolio is great. It’s so tempting. It’s like checking email obsessively: you get a little dopamine rush. But as we all know logically and rationally, it’s utterly nonproductive.”</p>
<p class="indent">This practice of <i>intentional disconnection</i> may seem perverse in a culture that prizes instant access to infinite information. But Sleep and Zakaria disavowed the standard game of ceaselessly collecting data and betting on what it might portend for stocks in the near term. They wanted to think in peace, undisturbed by the popular obsession with what Sleep termed “wiggle guessing.”</p>
<p class="indent">It requires uncommon conviction to disregard what most of your peers consider significant. But once they’d decided to shut off the noise from Wall Street, they felt joyously liberated. “It’s like a voice in your head [that’s] chattering away all the time,” says Sleep. “Stop listening to it and you’ll be fine.” So how did they spend their time? “We just read annual reports until we were blue in the face and visited every company we possibly could until we were sick of it.” Sleep traveled so much that he filled every page of a supersize passport and had to order another.</p>
<p class="indent">When they analyzed companies and interviewed CEOs, Sleep and Zakaria probed for insights with a long shelf life. They sought to answer such questions as <i>What is the intended destination for this business in ten or twenty years? What must management be doing today to raise the probability of arriving at that destination? And what could prevent this company from reaching such a favorable destination?</i> They referred to this way of thinking as “destination analysis.”</p>
<p class="indent">Wall Street tends to fixate on short-term outputs, favoring questions such as <i>What will this company’s profits be over the next three months?</i> and <i>What is our twelve-month price target for this stock?</i> Sleep and Zakaria focused instead on the inputs required for a business to fulfill its potential. For example, they wanted to know, <i>Is this company strengthening its relationship with customers by providing superior prod</i><span aria-label="page 151" id="page_151" role="doc-pagebreak"/><i>ucts, low prices, and efficient service? Is the CEO allocating capital in a rational way that will enhance the company’s long-term value? Is the company underpaying its employees, mistreating its suppliers, violating its customers’ trust, or engaging in any other shortsighted behavior that could jeopardize its eventual greatness?</i></p>
<p class="indent">It’s worth noting that destination analysis is an equally handy tool in other areas of life. If, say, your goal is to be healthy in old age, you might ask yourself what inputs (in terms of nutrition, exercise, stress reduction, medical checkups, and the like) are required now to boost your odds of reaching that destination. If you want to be remembered lovingly by your family and friends, you might picture them at your funeral and ask how you need to behave today so they will cherish the memory of you. This emphasis on destinations had a profound impact on Sleep and Zakaria. “You want to look back at eighty,” says Sleep, “and think that you treated your clients equitably, did your job properly, gave money away properly—not that you had four houses and a jet.”</p>
<p class="indent">It came naturally for them to think along unconventional lines because they were two odd ducks who had landed in the investment industry by accident—a failed landscape architect and a frustrated meteorologist. As perennial outsiders, they questioned everything. Above all, they could never accept the unspoken belief that their own financial interests trumped those of their clients. As a result, Nomad’s fee scheme was uncommonly fair. Sleep and Zakaria charged a tiny annual management fee that merely covered their costs, instead of the usual fee of 1 or 2 percent of assets. They also received 20 percent of their fund’s investment profits, but only <i>after</i> delivering a 6 percent annual return. If they performed poorly, they would earn no fees at all.</p>
<p class="indent">A few years later, they stacked the deck even more heavily against themselves by deciding to place their performance fees in a holding bucket for several years. If Nomad subsequently fell short of its 6 percent annual hurdle, they would <i>refund</i> a portion of those previously earned fees to their shareholders. “We quite liked the idea that this wasn’t going to be a big payday for us,” says Zakaria. “We wouldn’t make out like bandits as everyone else does.”</p>
<p class="indent">Their attitude was influenced by <i>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</i>, which Sleep had recommended to Zakaria shortly after they <span aria-label="page 152" id="page_152" role="doc-pagebreak"/>met. The book reinforced their determination to resist any low-quality behavior that seemed self-serving or deceitful. “The very rapid rejection of things made life very straightforward,” says Zakaria. “It was all about quality.… Money was secondary. It was much more about doing a good job, a <i>quality</i> job, doing the right thing. I don’t think we ever took a decision which was driven by—”</p>
<p class="indent">“—putting money in <i>our</i> pockets. Definitely not,” says Sleep, completing Zakaria’s thought.</p>
<p class="indent">“There was something a little provocative about the whole thing,” says Zakaria. “Could you set up an investment outfit which is not about the money? It’s about doing everything right.”</p>
<p class="indent">As you’d expect, the priority at most investment firms is to maximize their own profits, which creates some glaring conflicts of interest. For example, they routinely prosper by selling overpriced products that deliver lackluster returns. They also place an overwhelming emphasis on increasing their assets under management, since this generates bounteous fees with which to bankroll lavish salaries and bonuses. It’s no secret that investment returns tend to deteriorate as assets expand. But money managers typically resist the logical solution of closing their oversize funds to additional investments. As the author Upton Sinclair wrote, “It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends upon his not understanding it!”</p>
<p class="indent">By contrast, Nomad was conceived from the start as a vehicle for maximizing returns, not assets. “We had a different morality system,” says Sleep. “If you’re in the asset-gathering business, then you’ve got sales guys, you’ve got compliance guys, you’ve got client-holding people, you’ve got bureaucracy, and it becomes this big machine. If you’re wanting to compound and have really good investment performance, you don’t need any of that crap.… We just concentrated on picking good stocks and thought everything else was peripheral.”</p>
<p class="indent">For a start, they regarded sales and marketing as a distraction. They almost never spoke to the media. They didn’t care if a potential client was large or small since their priority was never to build the most lucrative commercial enterprise. They also made it clear that they’d return money to their existing shareholders and turn away new investors if Nomad’s size ever became a hindrance to its performance. They <span aria-label="page 153" id="page_153" role="doc-pagebreak"/>repeatedly closed the fund to new subscriptions, starting in 2004 when they managed about $100 million—a paltry sum by industry standards. They reopened only when they could find sufficiently alluring opportunities to deploy additional cash.</p>
<p class="indent">They also took delight in turning away investors who seemed unsuitable or irritating, regardless of how rich they were. Zakaria chuckles at the memory of a comically awful meeting with a team that managed billions for heirs to the food-packaging company Tetra Pak. These financial advisers demanded access to Nomad’s proprietary stock research as a condition for investing their clients’ money in the fund. Zakaria says the atmosphere grew “frostier and frostier,” with Sleep crossing his arms and legs in a sign of mounting annoyance. After fifteen minutes, Sleep and Zakaria showed their visitors the door.</p>
<p class="indent">Potential investors were also required to sign a document acknowledging that Nomad was inappropriate for anyone with less than a five-year time horizon. “I wanted it in a different psychic space than all the other investments they had,” says Sleep. “We weren’t just another bloody hedge fund.… We were tackling the whole investment problem in a different way.”</p>
<p class="indent">Indeed, Nomad rejected all of the get-rich-quick tactics that hedge funds routinely use to pump up their short-term performance—high-testosterone strategies that Sleep dubbed “investment Viagras.” For example, Nomad never used leverage, never shorted a stock, never speculated with options or futures, never made a macroeconomic bet, never traded hyperactively in response to the latest news, never dabbled in exotic financial instruments with macho names such as LYONs and PRIDEs. Instead, Sleep and Zakaria played what they viewed as “a long, simple game,” which involved buying a few intensively researched stocks and holding them for years.</p>
<p class="indent">Their slow, patient, deliberate strategy was so countercultural that it sounds almost quaint. Investor time frames have shortened drastically over the years. When Vanguard’s founder, Jack Bogle, entered the investment business in 1951, mutual funds held stocks for an average of about six years. By 2000, that figure had shrunk to about one year, provoking Bogle to warn that “the folly of short-term speculation has replaced the wisdom of long-term investing.” In 2006, Sleep wrote to <span aria-label="page 154" id="page_154" role="doc-pagebreak"/>shareholders that Nomad’s average holding period for stocks was seven years, whereas other investors held the US stocks in Nomad’s portfolio (excluding Berkshire Hathaway) for an average of only fifty-one days.</p>
<p class="indent">Sleep and Zakaria were appalled by this cultural shift toward short-termism. “We cannot for the life of us figure out why society at large is served by having company owners swap seats every few months,” wrote Sleep. “This basic building block of society is broken when those with their hands on the permanent capital change their minds with their underwear.” Nomad would succeed by taking the opposite approach. “The Bible would say that you want to build your house on rock rather than sand,” says Sleep. “You want to build something that has permanence.”<sup class="sup"><a href="footnotes.xhtml#footnote-014" id="footnote-014-backlink">IV</a></sup></p>
<h2 class="h2x">A House Built on Rock</h2>
<p class="noindent">Sleep and Zakaria named their fund Nomad because they were willing to roam anywhere in search of value. They were not trying to replicate a particular index or perform well on a <i>relative</i> basis. They were gunning for outstanding <i>absolute</i> returns, unconstrained by reference to what anyone else was doing. Their quest took them to some of the least popular corners of the globe.</p>
<p class="indent">The fund began trading on September 10, 2001—one day before the attack on the Twin Towers. Markets cratered as investors confronted unfathomable threats of terrorism, war, and economic disruption. Adding to the gloom, many investors were still in shock from the bursting of the tech bubble. Sleep and Zakaria invested boldly amid the turmoil, targeting temporarily depressed businesses that others were too scared to own, since the future seemed so precarious.</p>
<p class="indent">In the Philippines, they invested in Union Cement, the nation’s largest cement producer, after its stock had plunged from thirty cents to less than two cents. Pessimism was so pervasive that the market val<span aria-label="page 155" id="page_155" role="doc-pagebreak"/>ued the business at one-quarter of the replacement cost of its assets. In Thailand, they invested in Matichon, a newspaper publisher whose stock had crashed from $12 to $1. It traded at 0.75 times revenues and was worth about three times what they paid for it. In the United States, they bought preferred shares of Lucent Technologies, a fallen telecom star that had lost 98 percent of its value. These were classic “cigar butts”—not the best businesses, but fantastically cheap. By the end of 2003, Nomad’s net asset value had doubled as opportunistic bets like these paid off.</p>
<p class="indent">The supply of bargains dwindled as fears receded and markets revived. So Sleep and Zakaria ventured to one of the few remaining pockets of despair. In 2004, they crossed the border from South Africa into Zimbabwe. Under Robert Mugabe’s despotic rule, Zimbabwe’s economy was paralyzed by corruption, a currency collapse, the nationalization of many privately owned farms, and mobs of looters. Undaunted, Sleep and Zakaria bought a basket of four Zimbabwean stocks—virtual monopolies that traded as if they were almost worthless. Zimcem, a cement producer, sold on the stock exchange in Harare for <i>one</i>-<i>seventieth</i> of the replacement cost of its assets.</p>
<p class="indent">Writing to Nomad’s investors about the perverse appeal of this detested market, Sleep remarked, “The clients will hate it. Compliance will hate it. The consultants will hate it. Marketing will hate it. The size of the investment opportunity is tiny. It is not part of the benchmark.… It’s perfect.”</p>
<p class="indent">For a while, Nomad valued its basket of bargains at zero because trading on Zimbabwe’s stock exchange ceased entirely. The economy remained a catastrophe. Still, by the time Nomad sold the last of its Zimbabwean stocks in 2013, they’d risen between threefold and eightfold. As a souvenir, Sleep and Zakaria gave each Nomad shareholder a worthless banknote for 100 trillion Zimbabwean dollars, which the government had issued at the height of hyperinflation.</p>
<p class="indent">Nomad’s appetite for reasonable businesses selling at unreasonably low prices made sense, given the opportunities available at the time. But this strategy had one drawback. When stocks like these rebounded and were no longer that cheap, they had to sell them and hunt for new bargains. But what if nothing particularly attractive was on sale when <span aria-label="page 156" id="page_156" role="doc-pagebreak"/>they sought to redeploy those winnings? <b>An obvious solution to this reinvestment risk was to buy and hold higher-quality businesses that were more likely to continue compounding for many years.</b></p>
<p class="indent">This second strategy grew out of a costly mistake. In 2002, Nomad made its biggest wager to date, investing in Stagecoach, a debt-ridden British bus operator that had overreached disastrously while expanding overseas. The stock had crashed from £2.85 to 14p, but Sleep and Zakaria figured it could easily be worth 60p. In part, they were betting on a turnaround led by the founder, a former bus conductor who’d run the firm so adroitly in the past that he’d become one of Britain’s richest people. He came out of semiretirement to streamline the business and refocus on its neglected cash cow: the UK bus operation. His strategy worked. Sleep and Zakaria cashed out at around 90p and congratulated themselves on a sixfold gain. But Stagecoach was a better business than they’d realized. In late 2007, the stock hit £3.68. “We felt like a bit of a horse’s arse,” says Sleep. “We had framed it in our own minds as only ever being a cigar butt.”</p>
<p class="indent">Sleep and Zakaria started searching for other businesses run by farsighted managers whom they could trust to keep building wealth over time. “If they’re thinking rationally and thinking about the long term,” says Sleep, “you can subcontract the capital allocation decisions to them. You don’t have to be buying and selling shares.” They also began to wonder what characteristics account for the success of companies with unusually long shelf lives, and they would reach the revelatory conclusion that one business model may be more powerful than all the rest. Their term for it is <i>scale economies shared</i>.</p>
<p class="indent">The company that introduced them to this model was Costco Wholesale, an American discount retailer that embodied everything they sought in a business. When they first invested in Costco in 2002, its stock had tumbled from $55 to $30 amid concerns about the company’s low profit margins. But Sleep and Zakaria saw underappreciated strength in Costco’s fanatical focus on delivering value to shoppers. At the time, its customers paid a $45 annual membership fee, which gave them access to warehouses filled with dependable products sold at the lowest-possible prices. Costco marked up its goods by no more than 15 percent above cost, while a typical supermarket might mark up prices <span aria-label="page 157" id="page_157" role="doc-pagebreak"/>by 30 percent. Members had no need to forage elsewhere for bargains because Costco treated them so fairly. The company could have jacked up its prices and boosted margins, but that would have jeopardized its members’ trust.</p>
<p class="indent">To the skeptics on Wall Street, this generosity seemed soft and uncompetitive—the corporate equivalent of collectivism. But Sleep and Zakaria saw the long-term logic of Costco’s largesse. Satisfied customers kept returning and spending more money in its stores, thereby generating enormous revenues. As the company grew, it negotiated better deals with suppliers and kept driving down its famously low costs. Costco then shared these economies of scale with consumers by lowering its prices even further. Sleep and Zakaria estimated that its members saved $5 for every $1 that Costco kept for itself. The effect of this policy of self-restraint was a virtuous cycle that Sleep sums up like this: “Increased revenues begets scale savings begets lower costs begets lower prices begets increased revenues.”</p>
<p class="indent">Most big, successful corporations eventually lapse into mediocrity. But Costco’s readiness to <i>share</i> the benefits of its scale with customers meant that size became an advantage, not a burden, enabling the company to extend its edge over rivals that boasted higher margins. Costco, which was founded in 1983, <i>kept growing by giving back</i>, instead of grabbing all of the spoils for itself. Its low margins reflected patience, not weakness. Writing to Nomad’s investors, Sleep explained, “The firm is deferring profits today in order to extend the life of the franchise. Of course Wall Street would love profits today but that’s just Wall Street’s obsession with short-term outcomes.”</p>
<p class="indent">Sleep and Zakaria kept adding to their investment as their reverence for Costco grew. By 2005, it accounted for one-sixth of Nomad’s assets. Today, it remains one of the linchpins in their personal portfolios. During the eighteen years they’ve owned the stock, it’s risen from $30 to about $380, while also paying rich dividends. Still, they have no intention of selling it anytime soon, given the likelihood that Costco will continue to advance toward a desirable destination.</p>
<p class="indent">One benefit of their inactivity is that Sleep and Zakaria had time to read, think, and talk at length about what they were learning. Sleep has the mental agility to skip lightly between different disciplines—<span aria-label="page 158" id="page_158" role="doc-pagebreak"/>from business history to religion, neuroscience to sports—and to identify common themes and patterns. Zakaria, whom Sleep describes as “hugely intelligent,” has less breadth, but tends to probe more deeply. One subject they often discussed was the question of which business models work best. They kept a list of them on a whiteboard in their office. What emerged from these discussions was a conviction that nothing matches the might of the scale-economies-shared model in fostering corporate longevity.</p>
<p class="indent">When they studied Walmart’s annual reports from the 1970s, they realized that it had much in common with Costco. Likewise, durable winners such as Dell Computer, Southwest Airlines, and Tesco all followed a similar path. These formidably efficient firms kept costs low and passed most of their savings back to consumers, who reciprocated by doing more business with them.</p>
<p class="indent">In the same vein, GEICO and the Nebraska Furniture Mart—two of Buffett’s favorite businesses—continued to drive down costs as they grew, enabling them to save their customers so much money that it became increasingly difficult for rivals to compete. Henry Ford pulled off a similar trick a century ago, harnessing the benefits of assembly-line production to drop the price of a Model T touring car from $850 in 1908 to less than $300 in 1925. “So it’s not a new business model,” says Sleep. “But it does need to be pursued with an evangelical zeal.”</p>
<p class="indent">The culture of such companies is typically molded by visionary founders, not hired hands. They tend to be passionate about the smallest details, improving the customer experience, cutting costs even in good times, and investing for the distant future despite external pressures to report strong numbers now. “They have to be almost high on being iconoclastic,” says Sleep. These legendary figures include Sam Walton at Walmart, Jim Sinegal at Costco, Herb Kelleher at Southwest, and Rose Blumkin at Nebraska Furniture Mart. Blumkin, a Russian immigrant who worked from the age of six until after her hundredth birthday, built America’s biggest home-furnishings business by faithfully observing three commandments: “Sell cheap, tell the truth, don’t cheat nobody.”</p>
<p class="indent">Once Sleep and Zakaria understood the magic of this one business model, they made it the overriding focus of their fund. The attrac<span aria-label="page 159" id="page_159" role="doc-pagebreak"/>tion of cigar butts waned and they concentrated instead on a handful of companies that shared their economies of scale with customers. They were acutely aware of how little in life we ever truly know. But they <i>knew</i> that they had uncovered a deep truth. “That’s the best single thought you may have ever had in your life,” says Sleep. “It needs to dominate everything because you’re not going to get many insights like that. Everything else is a bit low quality, isn’t it? It’s a bit transitory. It doesn’t make a big difference.”</p>
<p class="indent">Sleep and Zakaria packed their portfolio with companies cut from the same cloth. They bet 15 percent of Nomad’s assets on ASOS, a British online fashion retailer with a cost advantage over traditional high street stores, and rode its stock up from £3 to £70. They invested heavily in Carpetright, a chain founded by Lord Harris, a British entrepreneur with severe dyslexia who inherited his father’s small business at fifteen and ended up with hundreds of stores across Europe. Nomad also became the largest foreign shareholder of AirAsia, the world’s lowest-cost airline. And then there was Amazon.com—the ultimate practitioner of scale economies shared.</p>
<p class="indent">When Sleep first encountered Amazon in 1997, it was an upstart bookseller preparing to go public. Its founder, Jeff Bezos, gave a presentation in London, explaining how his profitless start-up would offer an almost infinite selection of books, how it would gain a cost advantage by avoiding the expense of physical stores, and how it would reinvest its cash flow in other businesses. Sleep raced back to his office at Marathon and told his boss, “This is absolutely fantastic. It could be huge. And he says, ‘Yeah, okay, Nick, but what are they doing that nobody else can do?’ ”</p>
<p class="indent">It took years for Sleep and Zakaria to grasp the nature of Amazon’s competitive advantage. But eventually, the penny dropped. Bezos was following in the hallowed footsteps of the Ford-Walton-Sinegal gang—and the internet would enable him to turbocharge their classic strategy.</p>
<p class="indent">Like them, Bezos was ruthlessly efficient about controlling costs. According to Sleep, Amazon even went so far as to save $20,000 a year by removing the light bulbs from vending machines in its offices. Bezos was obsessed with saving money and time for customers. And he invested patiently for the future, seeding new business initiatives that he <span aria-label="page 160" id="page_160" role="doc-pagebreak"/>didn’t expect to bear fruit for five to seven years. Each year, he invested hundreds of millions of dollars in the form of discounted prices and shipping subsidies—a consummate display of deferred gratification.</p>
<p class="indent">True to form, Wall Street grumbled about Amazon’s lack of reported profits, failing to appreciate that Bezos was patiently laying the groundwork for mind-blowing growth. Writing to Amazon’s shareholders in 2005, Bezos explained that “relentlessly returning efficiency improvements and scale economies to customers in the form of lower prices creates a virtuous cycle that leads over the long term to a much larger dollar amount of free cash flow, and thereby to a much more valuable Amazon.com.” Sleep and Zakaria had found their corporate soul mate.</p>
<p class="indent">That year, Bezos launched Amazon Prime, a membership service that offered free two-day shipping for an annual fee of $79. He would later sweeten the deal by throwing in everything from free movies and TV shows to unlimited storage of photographs. In the short run, this overabundance of benefits and savings would hurt the bottom line. In the long run, it would strengthen customer loyalty and spur even more spending. When Bezos unveiled Prime, Sleep and Zakaria recognized instantly that it was the Amazonian equivalent of Costco’s annual membership fee. “Oh my God, I know <i>exactly</i> what game they’re playing here,” thought Sleep. “Amazon suddenly became Costco on speed.”</p>
<p class="indent">Nomad started buying Amazon aggressively in 2005 at around $30 per share. In 2006, Sleep and Zakaria resigned from Marathon and made Nomad a fully independent fund, giving themselves even more latitude to follow their idiosyncratic convictions. They bet 20 percent of the fund’s assets on Amazon and secured permission from their shareholders to go beyond that limit. A quarter of their clients yanked their money from Nomad, fearful of its overexposure to one stock.</p>
<p class="indent">Skepticism about Amazon continued to swirl. In the midst of the 2008 market meltdown, Sleep attended an event in New York where George Soros spoke about the threat of an impending financial apocalypse. Soros, one of the most successful traders in history, named just one stock that he was shorting as the world fell apart: Amazon.</p>
<p class="indent">Over lunch that day, Sleep caught up with Bill Miller, whose mutual funds owned the largest outside stake in Amazon. Miller had recognized Amazon’s strengths earlier than anyone else and had bought <span aria-label="page 161" id="page_161" role="doc-pagebreak"/>15 percent of the company. But he told Sleep that he’d been forced to reduce his holdings to meet redemption requests from investors fleeing from his funds. Sleep phoned Zakaria in London that evening and asked, “Are you sure we know what we’re doing because everyone here is going in another direction?” They had never felt more confident about a company’s eventual greatness. But what if they’d misanalyzed the business? What if they’d missed something and all the doubters were right? “Either we’re brilliant,” thought Sleep, “or we’re really toast.”</p>
<p class="indent">Amazon lost almost half of its market value in 2008, while Nomad fell 45.3 percent. Sleep and Zakaria held an emergency meeting in an appropriately posh location—McDonald’s—to discuss the possibility that Nomad’s future might be in peril if the market continued to crash. They shuddered at the thought of ending up as analysts at some shitty Wall Street firm.</p>
<p class="indent">Still, they didn’t crack. While others panicked, they exploited the market mayhem to upgrade their portfolio, concentrating even more heavily on the highest-quality companies, including Amazon, Costco, ASOS, and Berkshire Hathaway. When the rebound came, the rewards were breathtaking. From 2009 through 2013, Nomad returned 404 percent.</p>
<p class="indent">In early 2014, Sleep and Zakaria dissolved the Nomad Investment Partnership. By then, it had grown to about $3 billion in assets, giving them the scale to earn astronomical sums. But that had never been the purpose of their great adventure. Many funds “start with lots of cake as their goal,” Sleep writes in an email. “It’s not the cake that gratifies us. What we found gratifying was the process of solving the investment problem, learning along the way and doing as good a job as we knew how—they are all internal personal goals. The cake was then a (happy) byproduct.”</p>
<p class="indent">Zakaria, in particular, worried that the work would become repetitive. “Intellectually, we felt we had completely sucked it dry,” he says. “We had thought about this from every angle, about what we thought was important, and I think I’m right saying there was nothing left.” So they retired, hoping to devote the second half of their lives to supporting charitable causes. Sleep wrote a letter to Buffett, thanking him for his role in Nomad’s success. Buffett replied, “You and Zak have made the right choice. I predict you will find life is just beginning.”</p>
<p class="indent"><span aria-label="page 162" id="page_162" role="doc-pagebreak"/>In less than thirteen years, Nomad had gained a staggering 921 percent before fees—just short of their target of turning £1 into £10. Amazon, which had risen tenfold since 2005, had played a pivotal role. At one point, it had grown to about 40 percent of the fund’s assets.</p>
<p class="indent">In retirement, Zakaria kept half a dozen or so of his favorite stocks from Nomad’s portfolio. His biggest holding, Amazon, surpassed $3,000 per share in 2020, giving it a market value of $1.5 trillion and making Bezos the world’s richest person. Zakaria, who has never sold a share of Amazon in his personal portfolio, has about 70 percent of his money riding on that one stock. The rest is almost entirely invested in Costco, Berkshire Hathaway, and an online retailer named <a href="http://Boohoo.com">Boohoo.com</a>. Zakaria says he occasionally glances at his portfolio and wonders, “What would Nick do? And I think, ‘Nick wouldn’t do <i>anything</i>.’ And I go, ‘Okay, that’s done for another six months.’ ”</p>
<p class="indent">As for Sleep, he invested almost all of his money in just three stocks: Amazon, Costco, and Berkshire. “There are very few businesses that are investing in the future the way they are,” he says. “They don’t care about Wall Street. They don’t care about the trends and the fads. They’re just doing the right thing long term.” The volatility of a three-stock portfolio didn’t bother him, given the high probability that all three businesses would reach a desirable destination.</p>
<p class="indent">However, by 2018, Amazon had risen so meteorically that it accounted for more than 70 percent of his net worth. Sleep began to worry. Could its market value grow to $3 trillion or $4 trillion, or were there limits even to Amazon’s greatness? He wasn’t sure. So, after thirteen years, he sold half of his stake in a single day for $1,500 a share. How did it feel? “I hated it,” he says. “I felt horribly conflicted, and I’m not sure it’s a good decision.”</p>
<p class="indent">For a while, Sleep sat patiently on tens of millions of dollars in cash, not sure how to invest his windfall from selling those shares in Amazon. But when we spoke in 2020, he had invested the money in a <i>fourth</i> stock, ASOS—an online retailer that he’d previously owned at Nomad. Since he repurchased it, the stock had already doubled. In short, life is still sweet.</p>
<h2 class="h2x"><span aria-label="page 163" id="page_163" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Five Lessons with a Long Shelf Life</h2>
<p class="noindent">As I see it, there are five key lessons to be learned from Sleep and Zakaria. <b>First, they provide a compelling example of what it means to pursue quality as a guiding principle in business, investing, and life—a moral and intellectual commitment inspired by</b> <span class="bolditalic">Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</span>. It’s easy to dismiss quality as a vague and subjective notion, but it offers a surprisingly useful filter for many decisions. For example, it was obvious to Sleep and Zakaria that a low annual management fee that merely covered Nomad’s operating costs was a higher-quality option than a fatter fee that would enrich them regardless of how they performed.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Second, there is the idea of focusing on whatever has the longest shelf life, while always downplaying the ephemeral.</b> This principle applied not only to the information they weighed most heavily, but also to the long-lasting companies they favored.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Third, there is the realization that one particular business model—scale economies shared—creates a virtuous cycle that can generate sustainable wealth over long periods.</b> Sleep and Zakaria took this one great insight and profited massively from it by focusing on a few high-quality businesses that followed a similar path. Paradoxically, they also argued that it was less risky for them to own a small number of stocks (usually about ten) than to own hundreds—a standard strategy that would inevitably have produced less dazzling returns. “We knew that we didn’t know many things,” says Sleep. “So it made sense to us only to have a few shares because those were the only things we ever understood and ever <i>really</i> knew.”</p>
<p class="indent">It was no surprise to them that the businesses they knew the best and loved the most—Amazon, Costco, and Berkshire—proved remarkably resilient even when the world was turned upside down by COVID-19. After all, their economies of scale enabled them to provide customers with exceptional value for money. “With Amazon and Costco, in particular, what you’ve seen is their businesses being <i>enhanced</i> by the crisis,” says Zakaria. “The worse the environment gets for the economy in general, the better it gets for these cost-advantaged businesses.”</p>
<p class="indent"><span aria-label="page 164" id="page_164" role="doc-pagebreak"/><b>Fourth, it’s not necessary to behave unethically or unscrupulously to achieve spectacular success, even in a voraciously capitalistic business where self-serving behavior is the norm.</b> During the financial crisis, Sleep wrote about the destruction caused by a culture in which “the players just have to win” and “are not too squeamish about the means.” He and Zakaria wanted Nomad to embody a more enlightened form of capitalism.</p>
<p class="indent">This explains why they adopted a fee scheme that favored their shareholders over themselves. They were generous to each other, too. For example, Zakaria insisted that Sleep should own 51 percent of their investment firm, instead of an equal share; if a disagreement were ever to arise, Zakaria trusted Sleep to make the final decision. Sleep says it was unthinkable to abuse a partner who had “loaded a revolver, passed it across the table, and said, ‘Go on, then, you can shoot me if you like!’ ” He adds, “There’s a kindness to the relationship, which I think is important to our success.” It’s telling that they still share an office several years after winding up their fund. As Sleep puts it, “Good behavior has a longer shelf life.”</p>
<p class="indent">A strong emphasis on charity is also a distinguishing feature of their gentle version of capitalism. “Once we had proved what we wanted to do running Nomad, it was very obvious to both of us that the job at hand was to give the money back to society,” says Sleep. “It lowers the risk of us being bent out of shape by having too much money.” Plus, “you have the joy of giving it away.”</p>
<p class="indent">Zakaria and his wife, Maureen, support an array of charities that are oriented toward scientific research and medicine, including the London Mathematical Laboratory, the Royal Society, and the Royal Hospital for Neuro-disability. Meanwhile, Sleep spends much of his time helping OnSide Youth Zones, a charity that creates safe havens where kids in poor areas can socialize and learn new skills. He says the primary focus for him and Zakaria has shifted to “doing the maximum amount of good… over the very long term.”</p>
<p class="indent">That said, Sleep hasn’t renounced <i>all</i> worldly pleasures. He loves motor racing and competes regularly in his 1965 Shelby Mustang GT350 and his 1967 Lola T70. He also took part with his daughter Jess <span aria-label="page 165" id="page_165" role="doc-pagebreak"/>in a thirty-six-day rally from Beijing to Paris (via Mongolia and Siberia), taking turns driving his 1964 Mercedes Pagoda.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Fifth, in a world that’s increasingly geared toward short-termism and instant gratification, a tremendous advantage can be gained by those who move consistently in the opposite direction.</b> This applies not only to business and investing, but to our relationships, health, careers, and everything else that matters.</p>
<p class="indent">Deferring gratification is no easy task, given the environment in which we live. In wealthier nations, everything is available on demand—limitless food, information, bingeable TV shows, every flavor of porn, or whatever else tickles our fleeting fancy. Our attention spans are shortening under a high-speed bombardment of emails, text messages, Facebook posts, and Twitter notifications. Similarly, in the investment realm, we can now dart in and out of the market instantaneously by pushing a few keys on our mobile phones. We’re all struggling in our own ways to adjust to this technological and social revolution, which is both miraculous and perilous. As pleasure-seeking creatures, we tend to be drawn to whatever feels good now, despite the price that we (or others) may have to pay later. This is evident not just in our individual lives but collectively in everything from government deficits to unconstrained energy consumption.</p>
<p class="indent">“It’s all about deferred gratification,” says Sleep. “When you look at all the mistakes you make in life, private and professional, it’s almost always because you reached for some short-term fix or some short-term high.… And that’s the overwhelming habit of people in the stock market.”</p>
<p class="indent">Just think for a moment of the many unchecked impulses that ruin investors’ returns: for example, the tendency to trade too frequently; to make emotional decisions based on alarming or alarmist news stories; to join the herd in charging after the most popular (and overpriced) assets; to dump funds that have lagged for a year or two; or to sell winning stocks prematurely, instead of leaving them to compound for years. The ability to resist such urges is “one of those big superpowers,” says Sleep. “You need to give it huge weight when you’re weighing what works.”</p>
<p class="indent"><span aria-label="page 166" id="page_166" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Sleep and Zakaria are titans of impulse control. How else could they have held Costco for eighteen years and Amazon for sixteen years while it has soared from $30 to more than $3,000 per share? They understood the fundamental truth that we benefit by deferring gratification and prioritizing long-term outcomes. But it’s not enough to grasp this principle intellectually. Equally important, they constructed an internally consistent ecosystem that <i>supported</i> such behavior.</p>
<p class="indent">For a start, most of their investors were nonprofits (such as college endowments) with expansive time horizons. In his shareholder letters, Sleep praised them effusively for their “gentle patience”—a tactful way of reinforcing the right mindset. Nomad also invested in businesses run by fellow nonconformists, such as Bezos and Buffett, who took an exceptionally long view. It helped, too, that Sleep and Zakaria set themselves up in a peaceful office above a Chinese herbal medicine store on the King’s Road, far removed from the frenetic action in major investment hubs. They also eliminated disruptive influences by shunning sell-side analysts and financial consultants (who compulsively monitor the day-to-day performance of funds). They were so detached from all of the drama and excitement that they likened themselves to hermits or monks.</p>
<p class="indent">If you and I hope to achieve long-lasting success as investors, we need to follow their example by <i>systematically resisting the external and internal forces that push us to act impetuously</i>. With that in mind, I ignore all of the useless media chatter about looming market corrections and crashes. I go weeks on end without checking how my investments have performed.<sup class="sup"><a href="footnotes.xhtml#footnote-013" id="footnote-013-backlink">V</a></sup> My default position is to do nothing. Hence, the majority of my portfolio sits quietly in two index funds and a value-oriented hedge fund, all of which I’ve owned for at least twenty years. My costliest mistakes have come whenever I grew impatient or envious of other people’s returns and strayed off course by gambling on private <span aria-label="page 167" id="page_167" role="doc-pagebreak"/>companies or individual stocks that held the promise of a racier route to riches. The paradox here is that the slower road almost always proves to be faster in the end.</p>
<p class="indent">The investors I admire most tend to be heroically inactive, not because they’re lazy but because they recognize the benefits of patience. Howard Marks once told me, “Our performance doesn’t come from what we buy or sell. It comes from what we hold. So the main activity is holding, not buying and selling. I’ve always wondered if it wouldn’t enhance an organization to say, ‘We only trade on Thursdays.’ And the other four days of the week, all you can do is sit and think.”</p>
<p class="indent">Nobody personifies this slow-motion mindset better than Thomas Russo, who has generated market-beating returns over more than three decades at Gardner Russo &amp; Gardner, which is based in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. “I call myself a farmer,” says Russo. “Wall Street is flooded with hunters—people who try to go out and find the big game. They fell it and bring it back, and there’s a huge feast and everything is fabulous, and then they look for the next big game. I plant seeds and then I spend all of my time cultivating them.” His biggest holdings include Berkshire Hathaway, Brown-Forman, and Nestlé, all of which he’s owned since the 1980s. A few years ago, when he was fifty-nine, I asked Russo if he expected to own Berkshire and Nestlé for the rest of his life. He replied without hesitation, “I would think so.”</p>
<p class="indent">Like Sleep and Zakaria, Russo has built his entire career on an appreciation of the power of deferred rewards. All of the businesses he owns share one trait, which he describes as “the capacity to suffer.” That’s to say, they invest for “the very long haul,” even when this expense requires them to stomach years of painful upfront losses. As Russo remarks, we tend to benefit whenever we “sacrifice something today” to “gain something tomorrow.”</p>
<p class="indent">What’s fascinating to me is that this timeless principle applies not only to business and investing, but to every area of our lives. We can see it when we exercise or diet, when we study hard for an exam or stay late at work, and when we save money or invest for retirement. In each case, we profit in the long run by embracing or enduring something that seems unappealing in the short run. Conversely, says Sleep, “I think it’s almost always true that the things we do that make us unhappy” look <span aria-label="page 168" id="page_168" role="doc-pagebreak"/>appealing “in the short term.” He cites an array of popular pitfalls: getting drunk, “eating too much cake,” telling lies, “visiting girlie bars,” and “nicking sweets from a corner shop.” In the moment, he says, “all of these things seem like a good idea. They’re exciting. They reward. There’s a bit of a rush. But in the end, they borrow from the long term.”</p>
<p class="indent">None of this is new. In the book of Genesis, Esau—a sucker for instant gratification—trades his precious birthright to his brother, Jacob, in return for a worthless bowl of lentil soup. By contrast, Jacob’s son, Joseph—a master of deferred gratification—has the foresight to set aside vast quantities of grain during the “seven years of abundance,” ensuring that Egypt survives the “seven years of famine” that follow. Thousands of years later, we’re presented over and over with this same choice between the <i>present</i> and the <i>future</i>, the <i>instant</i> and the <i>deferred</i>.</p>
<p class="indent">For most of us mortals, it’s a challenging choice. But Zakaria says he enjoyed the slightly pious feeling of donning a “hair shirt” and “rejecting instant gratification” while others succumbed to temptation. This reminds me of a marvelous Buddhist phrase that’s used to describe one of the subtle rewards of resisting unhealthy or unskillful behavior: <i>the joy of nonremorse</i>. Likewise, kabbalists such as Rav Yehuda Ashlag and Rav Philip Berg teach that the only way to achieve enduring happiness, fulfillment, and freedom is to resist our negative inclinations. In his landmark book <i>Kabbalah for the Layman</i>, Rav Berg writes, “Instead of choosing the line of least resistance, the quick fix, instant gratification, the kabbalist chooses the line of most resistance.” It’s a profoundly important truth about the counterintuitive path to contentment.</p>
<p class="indent">One practical trick, says Sleep, is to “reward yourself in the short term” by relishing the prospect of all the wonderful benefits you will enjoy because you chose to override your desire for instant gratification. That way, deferral becomes associated with pleasure and “you’re much more likely to embrace it.” Indeed, says Sleep, “I quite <i>like</i> the overriding because you just know that it’s going to make your life better.”</p>
