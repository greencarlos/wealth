      <p class="first2 pcalibre1"><span class="first-letter2">A</span> marketing professor asked his students, “If you were going to open a hotdog stand, and you could only have <i class="calibre2">one</i> advantage over your competitors . . . which would it be . . . ?”</p>
      <p class="subsq"><i class="calibre2">“Location! ….Quality! …. Low prices! ….Best taste!”</i></p>
      <p class="subsq">The students kept going until eventually they had run out of answers. They looked at each other waiting for the professor to speak. The room finally fell quiet.</p>
      <p class="subsq">The professor smiled and replied, “<i class="calibre2">A starving crowd.”</i></p>
      <p class="subsq">You could have the worst hot dogs, terrible prices, and be in a terrible location, but if you’re the only hot dog stand in town and the local college football game breaks out, you’re going to sell out. That’s the value of a starving crowd.</p>
      <p class="subsq">At the end of the day, if there is a ton of demand for a solution, you can be mediocre at business, have a terrible offer, and have no ability to persuade people, and you can <i class="calibre2">still</i> make money.</p>
      <p class="subsq">An example of this was the toilet paper shortage at the beginning of Covid-19. There was no offer. The pricing was atrocious. And there was no compelling sales pitch. But because the crowd was so big and so starving, rolls of toilet paper were going for $100 or more. That’s the value of a starving crowd.</p>
      <p class="subsq"><b class="calibre1">Selling Newspapers</b></p>
      <p class="subsq">A good friend of mine, Lloyd, owned a software business that served newspapers for almost a decade. They set up digital ad services on newspaper websites with a few clicks and instantly helped them sell a whole new ad product. He only charged them a percentage of the revenue he added. So if they made nothing, neither did he. It was pure gain for the papers and a great offer.</p>
      <p class="subsq">But, despite having a great offer and natural sales ability, his business began to decline. Being a high-achieving entrepreneur, he tried all the different angles to solve the problem — <i class="calibre2">but nothing worked</i>. He couldn't figure out what the issue was. It was hard for me to see him struggle with this because I think Lloyd is much smarter than I am, and the answer seemed obvious to me. But watching him go through this has been a lesson I have taken with me for life. Before I reveal it, what do you think the problem was? Product? Offer? Marketing and sales? His team?</p>
      <p class="subsq">Let’s break it down. It wasn’t his product — that was great. It wasn’t his offer — he had a zero risk revshare model. It wasn’t his sales skills — he was a natural salesman. So, then what was the problem? <i class="calibre2">He was selling to newspapers!</i> His market was shrinking by 25 percent <i class="calibre2">every year</i>! He had looked at all the angles, except for the most obvious one. Finally, after<i class="calibre2"> </i>years of fighting an uphill battle in his market, he realized his market was the source of his problems and decided to downsize his company.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Don’t worry — this story has a second half. To illustrate the power of a market, as soon as COVID hit, Lloyd pivoted. He started an automated mask manufacturing company. With new technology, he brought the cost per mask below what people could buy them for from China. Within five months he was doing <i class="calibre2">millions per month</i>. Same entrepreneur. Different market. He applied his <i class="calibre2">same</i> skill set to a business <i class="calibre2">he had zero experience in</i> and was able to win. That’s the power of picking the right market.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I give you that story as a cautionary tale. <i class="calibre2">Your market matters.</i> Lloyd is a <i class="calibre2">very</i> smart human. He is obviously very capable. But we can all be blinded as entrepreneurs because we don't like to give up. We are so accustomed to solving impossible problems that we will keep ramming our heads into the wall. We hate quitting. But the reality is that everyone is affected by their market.</p>
      <p class="subsq">So how do you pick the right market?</p>
      <p class="subsq"><b class="calibre1">What To Look For</b></p>
      <p class="subsq">There is a market in desperate need of your abilities. You need to find it. And when you do, you will capitalize, all while wondering what took you so long. Don’t be romantic about your audience. Serve the people who can pay you what you’re worth. And remember that picking a market, like anything, is always our choice, so choose wisely.</p>
      <p class="subsq">In order to sell anything, you need demand. We are not trying to <i class="calibre2">create</i> demand. We are trying to <i class="calibre2">channel</i> it. That is a very important distinction. If you don’t have a market for your offer, nothing that follows will work. This entire book sits atop the assumption that you have at least a “normal” market, which I define as a market that is growing at the same rate as the marketplace and that has common unmet needs that fall into one of three categories: improved health, increased wealth, or improved relationships. For example Lloyd, from the above newspaper story, could have gone through this entire book and nothing in here would have worked for him. Why? Because he would be targeting newspapers, a dying market.</p>
      <p class="subsq">That being said, having a great market is an advantage. <span class="underline">But you can be in a normal</span> <span class="underline">market that’s growing at an average rate and still make crazy money</span>. Every market I have been in has been a normal market. You just don't <i class="calibre2">actually</i> want to be selling ice to eskimos.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Here are the basic tenets of what I look for in markets. Let’s run through them before we return to the offer.</p>
      <p class="subsq">When picking markets, I look for four indicators:</p>
      <div class="inline-image3">
        <div class="inline-image-container2">
          <img src="../images/00016.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre3"/>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p class="subsq"><b class="calibre1">1) Massive Pain</b></p>
      <p class="subsq">They must not want, but desperately need, what I am offering. Pain can be anything that frustrates people about their lives. Being broke is painful. A bad marriage is painful. Waiting in line at the grocery stores is painful. Back pain . . . ugly smile pain . . . overweight pain . . . Humans suffer a lot. So for us entrepreneurs, endless opportunity abounds.</p>
      <p class="subsq">The degree of the pain will be proportional to the price you will be able to charge (more on this in the Value Equation chapter). When they hear the solution to their pain, and inversely, what their life would look like <i class="calibre2">without</i> this pain, they should be drawn to your solution.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I have a saying I use to train sales teams <i class="calibre2">“The pain is the pitch.”</i> If you can articulate the pain a prospect is feeling accurately, they will almost always buy what you are offering. A prospect must have a painful problem for us to solve and charge money for our solution.</p>

        <p class="subsq1">The point of good persuasion is for the prospect to feel <i class="calibre2">understood.</i></p>
        </blockquote>
      </div>
      <p class="subsq"><b class="calibre1">2) Purchasing Power</b></p>
      <p class="subsq">A friend of mine had a very good system for helping people improve their resumes to get more job interviews. He was great at it. But try as he did, he just could not get people to pay for his services. Why? Because they were all unemployed!</p>
      <p class="subsq">This, again, may seem obvious. But he thought, <i class="calibre2">“These people are easy to target. They’re in</i> <i class="calibre2">massive pain. There are plenty of them, and it's constantly adding new people. This is a great market!”</i></p>
      <p class="subsq">He just forgot a crucial point: your audience needs to be able to afford the service you’re charging them for. Make sure your targets have the money, or access to the amount of money, needed to buy your services at the prices you require to make it worth your time.</p>
      <p class="subsq"><b class="calibre1">3) Easy to Target</b></p>
      <p class="subsq">Let’s say you have a perfect market, but no way of finding the people who comprise it. Well, making a Grand Slam Offer will be difficult. I make my life easier by looking for easy-to-target markets. Examples of this are avatars that have associations they belong to, mailing lists, social media groups, channels they all watch, etc. If our potential customers are all gathered together somewhere, then we can market to them. If searching them out, however, is like finding needles in a haystack, then it can be very difficult to get your offer in front of any potentially interested eyes.</p>
      <p class="subsq">This point is tactical. It is reality, not theoretical. For instance, you may <i class="calibre2">want</i> to serve rich doctors. But if your ads are being displayed to nursing students, your offer will fall on deaf ears, no matter how good it is. Main point: you want to make sure you can target your ideal audience easily. <i class="calibre2">(Clarifying point - there is no issue wanting to serve rich doctors, they are easy to</i> <i class="calibre2">find. This is just illustrative that your promotions must be served to the right audience).</i></p>
      <p class="subsq"><b class="calibre1">4) Growing</b></p>
      <p class="subsq">Growing markets are like a tailwind. They make everything move forward faster. Declining markers are like headwinds. They make all efforts harder. This was Lloyd's example. Newspapers had three of the four makings of a great market: (1) lots of pain, (2) purchasing power, (3) easy to target. But they were shrinking (fast). No matter how hard he tried, the entire marketplace was fighting against him. Business is hard enough, and markets move quickly. So you might as well find a good market to give you a tailwind to make the process easier.</p>
      <p class="subsq"><b class="calibre1">Making This Real</b></p>
      <div class="inline-image3">
        <div class="inline-image-container">
          <img src="../images/00017.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre3"/>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p class="subsq">There are three main markets that will always exist: Health, Wealth, and Relationships. The reason that those will always exist is that there is always tremendous pain when you lack them. There is always demand for solutions to these core human pains. The goal is to find a smaller subgroup within one of those larger buckets that is growing, has the buying power, and is easy to target (the other three variables).</p>
      <p class="subsq">So if I were a relationship expert trying to find my avatar, I’d rather focus on “second half of life relationship” coaching for old timers than helping college students in relationships. Why? Because senior citizens who are alone are likely suffering more pain as they are nearer their deaths (pain), have more buying power (money), and are easy to find (targeting). Lastly, at the time of this writing, there are more people turning 65 each year than turning 20 (growing).</p>
      <p class="subsq">That is the idea. Think about what you are good at in regards to health, wealth, and relationships. Then think about who might value your service the most (is in the most pain), has the buying power to pay what <i class="calibre2">you</i> want (money), and can be found easily (targeting). As long as those three criteria are strong <i class="calibre2">and</i> the market isn't shrinking, you’ll be in good shape.</p>
      <p class="subsq">But how important to your success is finding a “great market” versus a “normal market” versus a “bad market?” The answer: it actually depends. Let me explain.</p>
      <p class="subsq"><b class="calibre1">Order of Importance: Three Levers on Success</b></p>
      <p class="subsq">It’s unlikely you are going to be in a dying market like the newspaper example. It’s also unlikely you’re going to be selling toilet paper in COVID (buying frenzy). You’ll likely be in a “normal” market. And that’s totally okay. There is a fortune to be made within normal markets. My single point here is that you can't be in a “bad” market, or nothing will work. That being said, here’s the simplest illustration of the order of importance between markets, offers, and persuasion skills:</p>
      <div class="alignment-block">
        <div class="title-page-contributor-primary-block">
        <p class="alignment-block-content2"><b class="calibre1">Starving Crowd (market) &gt; Offer Strength &gt; Persuasion Skills</b></p>
      </div>
      </div>
      <p class="subsq">Let’s say you were to rate these elements on a scale of great, normal, and bad. You could essentially move down the line from left to right in order of importance. A “great” rating on a higher-order piece overpowers anything else lower on the priority scale. A “normal” rating moves the buck to the next part of the equation. A “bad” stops the equation <i class="calibre2">unless</i> a “great” from a higher priority component nullifies it. Here are a few examples:</p>
      <p class="subsq"><span class="underline">Example #1:</span> Even if you have a bad offer and are bad at persuasion, you’re going to make money if you’re in a great market. If you’re on the corner hocking hot dogs when the bars close up at 2am, with mobs of starving drunk folks, you’re gonna sell out your hotdogs.</p>
      <p class="subsq"><span class="underline">Example #2 (most of us):</span> If you are in a normal market and have a Grand Slam Offer (great), you can make tons of money even if you’re bad at persuasion. This is most people reading this book. That’s why I wrote it — to help you maximize your success by learning to really build a Grand Slam Offer.</p>
      <p class="subsq"><span class="underline">Example #3</span>: Let’s say you’re in a normal market and have a normal offer. In order to be massively successful, you would <i class="calibre2">have</i> to be <i class="calibre2">exceptionally</i> good at persuasion. Then and only then will you succeed, with your persuasive skills serving as the fulcrum of your success. Heck, many empires have been built by exceptional persuaders. It’s just the hardest path to follow and requires the most effort and learning. Nailing your offer helps you shortcut this path to success. Otherwise, you will just have a normal business that takes exceptional skill to be successful (nothing wrong with that, but probably not what you signed up for).</p>
      <p class="subsq"><b class="calibre1">Commit to the Niche</b></p>
      <p class="subsq">I have a saying when coaching entrepreneurs on picking their target market <i class="calibre2">“Don’t make</i> <i class="calibre2">me niche slap you.”</i></p>
      <p class="subsq">Too often, a newer entrepreneur half-heartedly tries <i class="calibre2">one</i> offer in <i class="calibre2">one</i> market, doesn't make a million dollars, then mistakenly thinks “this is a bad market.” Most times that’s not actually the case. They just haven’t found a Grand Slam Offer yet to apply to that market.</p>
      <p class="subsq">They think, <i class="calibre2">I’ll switch from helping dentists to helping chiropractors</i> — <i class="calibre2">that’s it!</i> When, in reality, both of those are normal markets and represent billions of dollars in revenue. Either would work, j<i class="calibre2">ust not both</i>. You must pick <i class="calibre2">one</i>. No one can serve two masters.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I have coined the term “niche slap” to remind entrepreneurs in my communities to commit once they pick. All businesses and, all markets, have unpleasant characteristics. The grass is never greener once you get to the other side. If you keep hopping from niche to niche, hoping that the market will solve your problems, you deserve to be <i class="calibre2">niche slapped.</i></p>
      <p class="subsq">You must stick with whatever you pick long enough to have trial and error. You will fail. In fact, you will fail until you succeed. But you will fail far longer if you keep changing who you market to, because you must start over from the beginning each time. So, pick then commit.</p>
      <p class="subsq"><b class="calibre1">Riches Are In The Niches</b></p>
      <p class="subsq">The other reason to commit to the niche is because of how much more you will make.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Simply put, niching down will make you far more money.</p>
      <div class="title-page-contributor-primary-block">
        <blockquote class="prose1">
        <p class="first1"><b class="calibre1">Author Note - When To Broaden (Advice For Most People)</b></p>
        <p class="subsq2">For most, if you are under $10M per year, niching down will make you more money. After that, it will depend on how narrow the niche is, or, what is called TAM (total addressable market). A business can really only grow to meet the total addressable market. That being said, for most people, getting to $10M per year is already a top .4% achievement (only 1 in 250 businesses achieve this). So for 99.6 percent of readers below $10M per year, it’s almost always easier to serve <i class="calibre2">fewer</i> clients <i class="calibre2">more narrowly</i>. But if you want to go beyond that, you<i class="calibre2"> <span class="underline">may</span> </i>(depending on the size of<i class="calibre2"> </i>your TAM) have to broaden your audience by going up market, down market, or into an adjacent market where your existing services can provide value.</p>
        <p class="subsq1">For context, many companies expanded to $30M+ per year serving a single niche: Chiropractors, Gyms, Plumbers, Solar, Roofers, Salon Owners, etc. If you are at $1M or $3M, thinking you have capped and must expand, you are wrong. You just need to be better.</p>
        </blockquote>
      </div>
      <p class="subsq">When I truly grasped how much more <i class="calibre2">profit</i> I was leaving on the table, it changed my life. It was what took me from doing acquisition for <i class="calibre2">anyone</i> to teaching it to a specific avatar. In my instance, I decided on a microgym owner with ~100 members, a signed lease, at least one employee, and wanted to help clients lose weight. That’s pretty specific compared to “small business owners” or “anyone who will pay me” which is common. And I was very specific. In that business (Gym Launch) - we turned down - and still do - anyone who is <span class="underline">not</span> that avatar. That means no personal trainers, no online coaches, etc.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Could I have helped them? Of course I could have. I mean heck, the majority of our portfolio is comprised of non-gym companies. But in order to maintain product focus, and high converting messaging, knowing <i class="calibre2">exactly</i> who the product was for was a game changer.</p>
      <p class="subsq">It helped us know <i class="calibre2">exactly</i> who we were speaking to at all times. And <i class="calibre2">exactly</i> whose problems we were solving.</p>
      <p class="subsq">But simplicity and ease may not be enough to sway you, so let me illustrate why honing in on <span class="underline">one niche will make you more money</span>.</p>
      <p class="subsq"><b class="calibre1">Reason</b>: you can literally charge 100x more for the<b class="calibre1"> </b><i class="calibre2">exact</i><b class="calibre1"> </b>same product. Dan Kennedy<b class="calibre1"> </b>was the first person to illustrate this for me, and I will do my best to pass on the torch to you in these pages.</p>
      <p class="subsq"><b class="calibre1"><span class="underline">Niching Product Pricing Example:</span></b></p>
      <p class="subsq"><b class="calibre1"><span class="underline">Example</span></b></p>
      <div class="inline-image3">
        <div class="inline-image-container2">
          <img src="../images/00018.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre3"/>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p class="subsq">Dan Kennedy taught me this (and it changed my life forever). Let’s say you sold a generic course on Time Management. Unless you were some massive time management guru with a compelling or unique story, it would be unlikely it would turn into anything significant. What do you think “yet another” time management course is valued at? $19, $29? Sure. Nothing to write home about. Let’s just say $19 for illustration sake.</p>
      <p class="subsq"><i class="calibre2">**Now we shall unleash the power of niche pricing in various stages on your product**</i></p>
      <p class="subsq">So let’s imagine you make the product more specific, keeping the same principles, and call it “Time Management For Sales Professionals.” All of a sudden, this course is for a more specific type of person. We could tie their increase to even one more sale or one more deal and it would be worth more. But there are a lot of sales people. So this might be a $99 product. Neat, but we can do better.</p>
      <p class="subsq">So let’s go down another level of niching and call our product…. “Time Management for B2B Outbound Sales Reps.” Following the same principles of specificity, now we know our sales people probably have very experienced deals and commissions. A single sale would easily net this salesman $500 (or more), so it would be easy to justify a $499 price tag. This is already a 25x increase in price for almost an identical product. I could stop here, but I’m going to go one step further.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Let’s just niche down one last level…. “Time Management for B2B Outbound Power Tools &amp; Gardening Sales Reps.” Boom.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Think about it for a second, if you were a power tools outbound sales rep, you would think to yourself “This is made exactly for me” and would <i class="calibre2">happily</i> fork over maybe $1000 to $2000 for a time management program that could help you achieve your goal.</p>
      <p class="subsq">The actual pieces of the program may be the same as the generic $19 course, but since they have been applied, and the sales messaging could speak so much to this avatar, they will find it more compelling <i class="calibre2">and</i> get more value from it in a real way. This concept applies to anything you decide to do. You want to be ‘the guy’ who services ‘this type of person’ or solves ‘this type of problem.’ And even more niched ‘I solve this type of problem for this specific type of person in this unique counter-intuitive way that reverses their deepest fear.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">That’s why a fitness program for generic weight loss might be priced at only $19 while a fitness program designed and marketed only to shift-nurses might be priced at $1997….(even though the core of the program is likely similar - eat less, move more).</p>
      <p class="subsq">End Result: The market matters. Your niche matters. And if you can sell the same product for 100x the price, should you?</p>
      <p class="subsq">I’ll let you decide.</p>
      <p class="subsq"><b class="calibre1">Summary Points</b></p>
      <p class="subsq">The purpose of this chapter is to reinforce two things. First, don't pick a <i class="calibre2">bad</i> market. Normal markets are fine. Great markets are great. Second, once you pick, commit to it until you figure it out.</p>
      <p class="subsq">If you try <i class="calibre2">one hundred offers</i>, <i class="calibre2">I promise</i> you will succeed. Most people never try anything. Others fail once, then give up. It takes resilience to succeed. Stop personalizing! It’s not about you! If your offer doesn’t work, it doesn’t mean you suck. It means your offer sucks. Big difference. You only suck if you stop trying. So, try again. You’ll never become world class if you stop after a failed attempt.</p>
      <p class="subsq">If you find a crazy good market, ride it, and ride it hard. And if you pair a Grand Slam Offer with a crazy market, you’ll likely never need to work again (seriously). So have this skill set — the ability to accurately assess markets by taking into account pain, money, targeting, and growth — in your back pocket so that when lightning strikes, you can make sure it strikes twice.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Having established how to nail a market, let’s get back to pricing. The first step to making crazy money is charging premium prices.</p>
