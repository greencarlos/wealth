<p class="chsub">How can we make smart decisions when nothing stays the same and the future is unknowable? Ask Howard Marks</p>
<p class="imageq"><img alt="Image" src="../images/common01.jpg"/></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote1">
<p class="chepi">That everything changes is the basic truth for each existence. No one can deny this truth, and all the teaching of Buddhism is condensed within it.</p>
<p class="chepiatt">—Shunryu Suzuki, <i>Zen Mind, Beginner’s Mind</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="noindent">When Howard Marks was an undergraduate at the University of Pennsylvania, he signed up for a class in studio art. It was an eccentric choice for a student majoring in finance, but Marks was a talented artist in his youth. “So I went to the art course, and the teacher walks in and looks around and says, ‘This is too many people. We have to weed out. I’m going to ask your name and your major.’ And so I said, ‘I’m Howard Marks, Wharton School of Finance.’ And he says, ‘Okay, you’re the first to go. Get out.’ ”</p>
<p class="indent">Evicted from Eden, Marks was forced to find another subject for his minor. To his surprise, he fell in love with Japanese literature, art, and civilization. It was in a class on Japanese Buddhism that he encountered the Zen concept of <i>mujo</i>, or impermanence.<sup class="sup"><a href="footnotes.xhtml#footnote-044" id="footnote-044-backlink">I</a></sup> Sitting in his corner office on the thirty-fourth floor of a skyscraper in midtown Manhattan, Marks explains how this ancient idea has shaped his philosophy <span aria-label="page 56" id="page_56" role="doc-pagebreak"/>of investing and life. “Change is inevitable. The only constant is impermanence,” he says. “We have to accommodate to the fact that the environment changes.… We cannot expect to control our environment. We have to accommodate to our environment. We have to expect and go with change.”</p>
<p class="indent">Marks acknowledges that everything is in a state of constant flux: nature, economies, markets, industries, companies, and our own lives. This is decidedly awkward for investors, since we’re engaged in betting very real money on circumstances that won’t last and on a future that’s unknowable. How can we make wise decisions in the face of such acute instability and uncertainty? As the famed investor Bill Miller once told me, “The world changes. This is the biggest problem in markets.”</p>
<p class="indent">Indeed, it’s a problem that pervades our lives. The French philosopher Michel de Montaigne wrote, “We, and our judgment, and all mortal things go on flowing and rolling unceasingly. Thus nothing certain can be established about one thing by another, both the judging and the judged being in continual change.” A prominent French investor, François-Marie Wojcik, was jubilant when I read him these lines, which Montaigne penned in the 1570s. Wary of overestimating his own (or anybody else’s) judgment in a constantly changing world where nothing certain can be established, Wojcik remarks, “I have three principles: doubt, doubt, and doubt.”</p>
<p class="indent">The problem of transience, which lies at the heart of Buddhist teaching, has long preoccupied the most thoughtful investors. T. Rowe Price,<sup class="sup"><a href="footnotes.xhtml#footnote-043" id="footnote-043-backlink">II</a></sup> founder of the Baltimore-based investment firm that bears his name, wrote an essay in 1937 titled “Change—the Investor’s Only Certainty.” Struggling to assess the geopolitical perils of his time, Price mentioned Hitler’s rise to power, then ventured a prediction that “Germany will acquire territory, preferably through peaceful means.” Two years later, Hitler invaded Poland, plunging the world into six years of war. Everything changed, but not in ways that Price or anyone else could predict with any precision.</p>
<p class="indent">Marks was born in 1946, a few months after the war ended, and grew <span aria-label="page 57" id="page_57" role="doc-pagebreak"/>up in Queens, New York, at a time when the pace of change seemed to him relatively slow and benign. “Comic books cost a dime for my entire youth,” he recalls. “We all thought that the world was a stable place and that events played out against an unchanging backdrop.… Now it’s clear that the world is changing all the time, unpredictably, at incredible speed. Nothing is the same anymore, and for people whose approach to life is based on sameness, that must be very upsetting.”</p>
<p class="indent">In the world of business, sameness and stability are not an option. Companies rise and fall, locked in a Darwinian struggle for supremacy and survival, and industry after industry is disrupted by technological innovation. Time Inc., where I spent much of my career as a journalist, recently ceased to exist after decades as the world’s dominant magazine publisher. When I joined in the 1990s, the firm was known as the “velvet coffin,” a resting place so rich and plush that we might never get out alive. In 2018, Time Inc. became a feeble unit within the Meredith Corporation, which made its hay with magazines such as <i>Successful Farming</i> and <i>Fruit, Garden and Home</i>. Meredith broke up the company like a junkyard car and sold the parts for scrap.</p>
<p class="indent">As investors, we long for definitive answers to complex questions about the future. <i>Will the stock market rise or fall? Will the economy thrive or flounder?</i> Marks points out that investing consists entirely of “divining the future.” In analyzing any asset, we must figure out what price to pay today, given our expectations of future profits and valuations. Likewise, in other areas of life “we have to deal with the future. We have to make decisions on where to live, what job to take, who to marry, and how many kids to have.” But if everything is changing faster than ever and tomorrow may look nothing like today, how can we position ourselves adroitly for what lies ahead?</p>
<p class="indent">Most people make their investment decisions (and life decisions) on the basis of an unreliable hodgepodge of half-baked logic, biases, hunches, emotion, and vague fantasies or fears about the future. I’ve moved countries several times without truly thinking it through, largely driven by whims or frustration.</p>
<p class="indent">By contrast, Marks is a master of disciplined and dispassionate thinking—a skill that has made him one of the undisputed giants of the investment world. As cochairman of Oaktree Capital Management, <span aria-label="page 58" id="page_58" role="doc-pagebreak"/>he oversees about $120 billion in assets. A pioneer in the field of alternative investing, Oaktree specializes in areas such as distressed debt, junk bonds, convertible securities, commercial real estate, and “control” investments in businesses with “untapped potential.” The firm’s clients include about seventy of the largest US pension funds, hundreds of endowments and foundations, and many of the world’s biggest sovereign wealth funds.</p>
<p class="indent">Oaktree’s stellar returns and reputation have made Marks rich. <i>Forbes</i> estimates his net worth at $2.2 billion. He used to own a $75 million estate in Malibu, and he later bought a $52.5 million pad in Manhattan. But ideas, not money, are his drug of choice. Above all, Marks is an original thinker—a man captivated by subjects such as risk, randomness, cyclicality, the psychology of investing, and the threat of what he calls “improbable disasters.”</p>
<p class="indent">Marks oversees Oaktree’s investment strategy, but he’s structured his job so that none of the firm’s 950 or so employees report to him. He has also handed off all day-to-day responsibilities for selecting individual investments, leaving himself free to read, think, and write. His memos, which he has penned for more than a quarter of a century, provide a priceless trove of financial wisdom. Warren Buffett once wrote, “When I see memos from Howard Marks in my mail, they are the first thing I open and read. I always learn something.” Marks turned his memos into an indispensable book, <i>The Most Important Thing: Uncommon Sense for the Thoughtful Investor</i>.</p>
<p class="indent">In person, he has the air of an unusually brilliant professor, peppering his speech with phrases such as “the rebuttable presumption has to be” and “in my myth of myself.” During our conversations, he naturally assumes the role of a teacher, pausing to draw a graph or to read from his well-thumbed copies of esoteric books such as C. Jackson Grayson’s <i>Decisions Under Uncertainty: Drilling Decisions by Oil and Gas Operators</i>. One of his greatest pleasures, says Marks, is sharing ideas and having people respond, “That was helpful. I never thought of that.”</p>
<p class="indent">To my mind, nobody in the investment world has thought more helpfully about what we can and cannot know, and how to <i>prepare</i> for the future instead of fooling ourselves into believing we can predict it. Faced with the challenge of making rational decisions, I’m sometimes <span aria-label="page 59" id="page_59" role="doc-pagebreak"/>tempted to throw up my hands in dismay. How can I possibly figure out a smart course of action, given the overwhelming complexity of the forces at play and how little control I have over the outcome? But Marks, whom I regard as a philosopher-king of finance, provides a set of profound insights and practical strategies that can help us immeasurably to navigate through the fog.</p>
<h2 class="h2x">First, Be Lucky. Second, Be Humble</h2>
<p class="noindent"><b>In a world where nothing is stable or dependable and almost anything can happen, the first rule of the road is to be honest with ourselves about our limitations and vulnerabilities.</b> As the Athenian playwright Euripides warned nearly twenty-five hundred years ago, “How can you think yourself a great man when the first accident that comes along can wipe you out completely?” Montaigne, one of the wisest of men, had this sentence inscribed on a beam in the library of his château.</p>
<p class="indent">Marks, who is keenly aware of the dangers of pride and arrogance, has decorated one wall of his office with a centuries-old painting of wooden sailing ships tossed around by terrifying waves. He bought it in 2001, at a time when foolhardy speculators had been dashed mercilessly against the rocks by the dot-com crash. The painting offers a disconcerting reminder that none of us is immune to the destructive power of forces that are bigger than us and beyond our control—a lesson we learned again in 2020 when, out of nowhere, a virus cast the whole world into chaos.</p>
<p class="indent">“Absolutely nobody had a pandemic on their radar screen, and then it turns out to be the defining event of our lives,” says Marks. “That in itself should convince us that we don’t know what’s going to happen.… Sometimes, we don’t even know what <i>could</i> happen.”</p>
<p class="indent">In the 1987 novel <i>The Bonfire of the Vanities</i>, Tom Wolfe coined the phrase <i>Masters of the Universe</i> to describe the hotshot investment bankers pulling down millions of dollars a year in bonuses. But as Marks sees it, “The screwiest thing you can do is to think you’re a Master of the Universe. We’re all just little cogs, and the universe will go on without us. We have to fit into it and adapt to it.”</p>
<p class="indent"><span aria-label="page 60" id="page_60" role="doc-pagebreak"/>When I ask him about a fellow billionaire who often makes bold predictions about the economy and the markets, Marks concedes that he’s “extremely smart,” but adds, “At the end of the day, the world will see if he’s as smart as he thought he was. Because if you think you’re smarter than you are, you get into trouble.… Sometimes I wish he didn’t think he’s as good as he is.”</p>
<p class="indent">One way that Marks keeps his own ego in check is by reminding himself of the starring role that luck has played in his life. After reading Malcolm Gladwell’s book <i>Outliers</i>, which explores various causes of success, Marks compiled a list of lucky breaks that have helped to propel him to where he is today.</p>
<p class="indent">His streak began with the “demographic luck” of being born to white, middle-class parents in the United States at the start of a golden era of postwar growth.<sup class="sup"><a href="footnotes.xhtml#footnote-042" id="footnote-042-backlink">III</a></sup> Nobody in his family had a college degree, but he was fortunate that his parents valued learning, bought an encyclopedia, and encouraged him to go to college. His high school grades were nothing special, so he thinks he was also lucky that Wharton accepted him. And it was Wharton that exposed him to finance, leading him to jettison his earlier ambition of a career in accounting. His second choice, a large state university, would certainly have lacked Wharton’s cachet among Wall Street recruiters.</p>
<p class="indent">I once gave an interview in which I mentioned that Marks has a high IQ, which has no doubt contributed significantly to his success. In response, he sent me a charmingly modest email, remarking, “People who don’t fully acknowledge their luck miss the fact that being intelligent is nothing but luck. No one does anything to ‘deserve’ a high IQ.”</p>
<p class="indent">After Wharton, Marks applied to the MBA program at Harvard, but (like Buffett) was rejected. Bad luck? Hardly. Instead, he ended up at the University of Chicago’s business school in 1967, when it was <span aria-label="page 61" id="page_61" role="doc-pagebreak"/>leading a revolution in financial theory. The “Chicago School” of academics had recently developed the efficient-market hypothesis, which contends that assets are correctly priced to reflect all of the relevant information available to investors. This theory gave rise to the belief that it’s impossible to beat the market consistently, which suggests that investors should settle for owning low-cost index funds that mirror the market’s returns. Indexing, as we’ll later discuss, is undeniably a smart option, given how difficult it is to outperform the market after expenses. As Marks puts it, “Most people should index most of their money.”</p>
<p class="indent">When he heard his professors’ explanations of market efficiency, Marks says he experienced the financial equivalent of satori, “the moment of enlightenment in Zen Buddhism.” It made sense to him that millions of investors hustling to earn a profit would “find the bargains and buy them up.” This is “not universally true,” he says, “but it makes a hell of a lot more sense than to think that something could be an obvious bargain and nobody else will tumble to it.”</p>
<p class="indent">Marks regards the efficient-market hypothesis as a “very powerful concept.” Still, there’s a big enough difference between academic theory and real-world practice for him to have earned billions for himself and his clients. There’s an old joke he tells, which goes like this: A professor of finance and a student are strolling across the Chicago campus. The student stops and exclaims, “Look! There’s a five-dollar bill on the ground!” The professor replies, “It <i>can’t</i> be a five-dollar bill or someone else would have picked it up already.” The professor walks away, so the student picks up the money and buys himself a beer. Appropriately, Marks keeps in his wallet a folded $5 bill that he once found in the Harvard Business School library—a reminder of the limitations of theory.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Marks drew a simple but life-changing lesson from these academic debates: if he wanted to add value as an investor, he should avoid the most efficient markets and focus exclusively on less efficient ones.</b> “The more a market is studied and followed and embraced and popularized, the less there should be bargains around for the asking,” he says. For example, it’s hard to find outlandish bargains among large US companies, a mainstream market where swarms of intelligent, highly motivated money managers tend to “drive out mispricings.” If you <span aria-label="page 62" id="page_62" role="doc-pagebreak"/>want to invest in large-cap stocks, it makes sense to buy and hold an index fund that tracks the S&amp;P 500, accepting that your odds of gaining a long-term edge in this efficient market are poor.</p>
<p class="indent">Marks would gain an edge by fishing in less popular ponds, such as the debt of distressed companies—an area that most investors avoid because it seems scary and opaque. He compares investing in inefficient markets to playing poker only against weak and error-prone opponents.</p>
<p class="indent">On graduating from Chicago, Marks applied for several jobs, including one at Lehman Brothers. “The one thing I was sure of was that I wanted that Lehman job.” To his dismay, the offer never came. So he took a position at First National City Bank, which later became Citibank. He spent the next decade there as a stock analyst and then as the director of research. Many years later, he learned from a campus recruiter that Lehman <i>had</i> decided to hire him, but the partner in charge of phoning him had a hangover and failed to deliver the good news. Marks often wonders what would have become of him if he’d received that call and built his career at Lehman. In 2008, the firm went bankrupt, losing all of its partners’ money and crashing the global economy.</p>
<p class="indent">After ten years in equity research, Marks was informed that Citibank was replacing him as head of the department, so he had to find a new role. He didn’t want to waste his time in a well-covered niche such as health-care stocks, where it would be hard to know more than other investors. “So I said, ‘I’ll do anything except spend the rest of my life choosing between Merck and Eli Lilly.’ Nobody is going to get <i>that</i> right more than fifty percent of the time.”</p>
<p class="indent">In the end, his boss told him to run two new funds in a realm where he had no experience: convertible securities and high-yield bonds. This may have been the luckiest break of all. Unwittingly, he was now positioned to ride a multidecade boom in new and exotic forms of credit, far beyond the dull, respectable domain of low-risk bonds with triple-A ratings.</p>
<p class="indent">We often assume that skill, not luck, is the most vital ingredient of success. Maybe. But it’s hard to beat the good fortune of starting at the ideal time to catch a monster wave. Michael Price, a legendary stock picker, once told me how his career took flight when he was hired at <span aria-label="page 63" id="page_63" role="doc-pagebreak"/>age twenty-four by a veteran value investor named Max Heine, whose lone mutual fund then had assets of just $5 million. “For two hundred dollars a week, I started on January second or third of 1975, which was the low point of the equity market for the century, except for the Great Depression,” Price told me. “No one in the US wanted to buy stocks. So I was lucky enough to get with a terrific value investor who’d been in the business for forty years at the low point of the modern bull market, when they were giving away stocks in America. So there was almost no way I could fail.” Over the next two decades, assets in the company’s mutual funds grew to around $18 billion. In 1996, Price sold the firm for more than $600 million.</p>
<p class="indent">It also helps if, like Marks and Price, you stumble into an opportunity that happens to suit your talents and temperament. “Debt fits my personality,” says Marks, “because you have a promise of repayment” when the bond matures, plus a promise of annual interest payments. If the debt is repaid, you know in advance what your return will be because it’s spelled out contractually.</p>
<p class="indent">The key is to avoid getting saddled with bad loans, so the first question to ask is whether the borrower is creditworthy. The second question is whether the borrower’s assets are sufficiently valuable, since the creditor will have a senior claim against those assets if the debt isn’t repaid. “I think these questions are answerable,” says Marks. In an uncertain world where so many questions are <i>unanswerable</i>, bonds offer a comforting measure of predictability and control. Bonds are also less risky than stocks, which is reassuring for a natural-born “worrier.”</p>
<p class="indent">What would have happened if his boss had given him a less appropriate assignment, such as running a venture capital fund? “That would have been terrible for me,” says Marks. “In venture capital, you’ve got to be a dreamer and a futurist.”</p>
<p class="indent">Still, when he started out in high-yield bonds in 1978, it wasn’t exactly a glamorous gig. Known colloquially as junk bonds, they were widely reviled as disreputable assets that posed an unacceptable risk of default. Marks says most investment organizations had a rule against buying them, and Moody’s declared that the entire category of B-rated bonds “fails to possess the characteristics of a desirable investment.” Ironically, this dogmatic belief that junk bonds <i>must</i> be a bad invest<span aria-label="page 64" id="page_64" role="doc-pagebreak"/>ment was what made them alluring to Marks: “When there’s a really powerful bias against an asset class, that’s a way to get a bargain. And that’s what I did.”</p>
<p class="indent">What the naysayers failed to grasp is a fundamental truth that enabled Marks, like Sir John Templeton before him, to make a fortune: <b>Any asset, however ugly, can be worth buying if the price is low enough. Indeed, Marks believes that “buying cheap” is the single most reliable route to investment riches—and that overpaying is the greatest risk. Thus, the essential question to ask about any potential investment should be “Is it cheap?”</b></p>
<p class="indent">Paradoxically, the prejudice against junk bonds made these supposedly risky assets so cheap that they became relatively unrisky. For Marks, much of the fascination of investing lies in such subtleties. In one of multiple memos that he’s written about risk, he muses, “I’m convinced that everything that’s important in investing is counterintuitive, and everything that’s obvious is wrong.”</p>
<p class="indent">Marks left Citibank in 1985 to work at a Los Angeles–based investment firm, TCW Group. One of his colleagues there, Bruce Karsh, came up with the idea for a distressed-debt fund, which would invest in the bonds of companies that were either in bankruptcy or veering toward it. Once again, Marks was quick to recognize the strange beauty of a poorly understood market that others found repellent. “If junk bonds are suspect,” he says, “what could be more disreputable than investing in the debt of companies that are bankrupt?” He and Karsh forged an enduring partnership. In 1995, they quit TCW and cofounded Oaktree. It would grow into a colossus, built largely on an unseemly foundation of junk and distressed debt.</p>
<p class="indent">Without luck, Marks would never have landed in these inefficient, bargain-rich markets. Without intellectual horsepower and independence of mind, he could never have exploited the opportunities he found there. “Look, luck is not enough,” he says. “But equally, intelligence is not enough, hard work is not enough, and even perseverance is not necessarily enough. You need some combination of all four. We all know people who were intelligent and worked hard but <i>didn’t</i> get lucky. It breaks my heart. People come to me all the time looking for jobs. They’re fifty years old, they lost their job, and they’re no less deserving.”</p>
<p class="indent"><span aria-label="page 65" id="page_65" role="doc-pagebreak"/>By reminding himself repeatedly of his good fortune, Marks protects himself from what I would call Master of the Universe Syndrome. His humility boosts his immunity against overconfidence, which is a persistent threat to the smartest (or luckiest) investors.</p>
<p class="indent">But there’s one other great benefit to acknowledging his luck: it makes him happy. “I walk around with this incredible feeling that I’m a lucky guy,” Marks confides. “If you’re a negative person, you might say, ‘Well, I’ve been lucky in my life and that really sucks because it means that my success is undeserved and may not continue.’ But I say, ‘Gee, what a great thing to be lucky. And, you know, I really owe it to somebody, whether it’s God or chance or whatever.’ ”</p>
<p class="indent">Templeton seemed to have little doubt that his success was divinely ordained. But what about Marks? He’s Jewish by birth but was raised as a Christian Scientist and went to church every Sunday as a child. These days, he considers himself Jewish, but not religious. “I’m a big believer in randomness,” he says, “and I just believe I’ve been lucky.”</p>
<h2 class="h2x">Know What You Don’t Know</h2>
<p class="noindent">Marks maintains a “huge compendium” of useful quotes that he’s amassed over decades, and he cites them frequently in explaining his investment credo. One of his favorite insights is from the economist John Kenneth Galbraith, an intellectual hero of his, who said, “We have two classes of forecasters: Those who don’t know—and those who don’t know they don’t know.”</p>
<p class="indent">The investment world is filled with people who believe (or pretend) that they can see what the future holds. They include smooth-talking “market strategists” from Wall Street brokerage firms who confidently predict the precise percentage rise of the stock market in the coming year, instead of acknowledging that they have no idea whether the market will go up or down; equity analysts who provide quarterly earnings estimates for the companies they cover, thereby feeding the illusion that profits are consistent and predictable, not lumpy and erratic; managers of macro hedge funds who place aggressive wagers on swings in currencies, interest rates, and anything else that moves; TV pundits and <span aria-label="page 66" id="page_66" role="doc-pagebreak"/>financial journalists who claim with a straight face to know what the latest (and mostly inexplicable) market fluctuations portend for investors.</p>
<p class="indent">But how much substance lies behind the bluster? Marks often quotes an observation by Amos Tversky, an Israeli psychologist who studied cognitive biases alongside Daniel Kahneman: “It’s frightening to think that you might not know something, but more frightening to think that, by and large, the world is run by people who have faith that they know exactly what’s going on.”</p>
<p class="indent">It’s worth pausing for a moment to let that unsettling idea lodge forever in your brain.</p>
<p class="indent">Occasionally, the forecasters get it right, but Marks regards these successes as proof of the adage that even a blind squirrel sometimes finds an acorn. That said, he acknowledges a small number of legitimate exceptions—investors such as George Soros and Stanley Druckenmiller who have repeatedly defied the odds by betting successfully on their macroeconomic predictions. “There are all these ways that I think you can’t be a good investor,” such as “forecasting the future” and “making huge bets” on the basis of those forecasts, says Marks. But certain individuals have proved him wrong “because what you mustn’t overlook is the human ingredient.”</p>
<p class="indent">Nonetheless, Marks himself is a staunch member of what he calls the “I Don’t Know” school of thought. <b>As he sees it, the future is influenced by an almost infinite number of factors, and so much randomness is involved that it’s impossible to predict future events with any consistency.</b> Recognizing that we can’t forecast the future might sound like a disheartening admission of weakness. In reality, it’s a tremendous advantage to acknowledge our limitations and operate within the boundaries of what’s possible. Out of weakness comes strength.</p>
<p class="indent">How does this awareness of his limitations liberate Marks from useless—or harmful—activities? For a start, he doesn’t squander any time attempting to forecast interest rates, inflation, or the pace of economic growth. Following his example, neither should we. If Marks can’t forecast such things, I’m fairly confident that I can’t do it, either. Unlike many of its rivals, Oaktree doesn’t even have an in-house economist, and the firm doesn’t invite outside “experts” to read the macroeconomic tea leaves.</p>
<p class="indent">Marks also eschews the idea of timing the market, given the impos<span aria-label="page 67" id="page_67" role="doc-pagebreak"/>sibility of repeatedly predicting the right moments to jump in and out. He noted in one of his earliest memos that the average annual return for stocks from 1926 to 1987 was 9.44 percent, but “if you had gone to cash and missed the best 50 of those 744 months, you have would have missed all of the return. This tells me that attempts at market timing are a source of risk, not protection.”<sup class="sup"><a href="footnotes.xhtml#footnote-041" id="footnote-041-backlink">IV</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Oaktree also tries to avoid what Marks describes as “future-oriented investments,” which rules out seductive assets such as tech stocks, purveyors of fashion items, and anything that reeks of faddishness. Early in his career, his department at Citibank was an exuberant cheerleader for one of the most infamous of fads, the Nifty Fifty—a group of high-octane growth stocks such as Xerox Corp., Avon Products, and Polaroid Corp., which reached head-spinning valuations before collapsing in 1973–74.<sup class="sup"><a href="footnotes.xhtml#footnote-040" id="footnote-040-backlink">V</a></sup> That experience left him with a permanent distrust for fantasies of never-ending growth projected into a distant, joyous future.</p>
<p class="indent">One of our conversations took place in 2017, during a heady period when Marks saw a similar outbreak of investment euphoria over the FANGs—Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and Alphabet (formerly Google). “People are acting like there’s no limit to their success and no price is too high,” he warned. “Historically, that’s been dangerous in most cases.… Trees have never grown to the sky. They may someday. I’m not going to bet on it.”</p>
<p class="indent">If his habitual skepticism means missing out on an occasional exception to the laws of gravity, that’s fine by him. Marks prefers to remain tethered to the ground by focusing on “reasonable propositions” where the price of a specific security is low relative to its intrinsic value. “It’s easy to invest in dreams,” he says. “The challenge is to discern value in what’s tangible today.”</p>
<p class="indent">Any investor who hopes to achieve enduring success should inter<span aria-label="page 68" id="page_68" role="doc-pagebreak"/>nalize this fundamental idea of buying assets below their value. As we’ve seen, this is a common thread that unites everyone from Buffett to Pabrai, Templeton to Marks.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>When analyzing any asset, what Marks wants to know, above all, is “the amount of optimism that’s in the price.”</b> With the FANGs, “there’s a lot of optimism. Too much? Who knows? Will one of them become the world’s first perpetual motion machine, the first company that (a) doesn’t stumble and (b) is not subject to disruption? I don’t know.” This combustible mixture of unknowability and rampant optimism is enough to scare him off—not because he knows precisely what will happen but because the probability of disappointment is too high.</p>
<p class="indent">In the months after our discussion, the FANGs continued to soar. But Marks is able to watch without regret when others hit the jackpot with what he regards as ill-advised bets. An incorrigible hoarder of wisdom, he has kept an old fortune cookie that says, “The cautious seldom err or write great poetry.” He’s comfortable with a prosaic approach that reduces the likelihood of catastrophic error: “You have to do what’s appropriate for your makeup. That’s very important.” When I ask about his most damaging investment mistakes, he replies, “I don’t remember ever making a big mistake of commission—just omission.”</p>
<p class="indent">In retrospect, Marks concedes that not owning Amazon was a mistake of omission. “But it was <i>not</i> a mistake to take a generally cautious approach” at a time when there was “too much confidence, too little risk aversion, too much capital trying to find a home, and too much use of leverage.” Those signs of excess led Oaktree to invest with heightened caution for several years.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, in March 2020, the eleven-year bull market ended when mounting terror over COVID-19 led the S&amp;P 500 to plunge by 33.9 percent in less than a month. Nobody could have predicted that a virus believed to have jumped from bats to humans in Wuhan would catalyze the quickest market meltdown in US history. “But if the market is precarious, you don’t <i>have</i> to know what the catalyst will be,” says Marks. “You only have to know that there’s a vulnerability.”</p>
<p class="indent">As the virus spread, the mood among investors flipped from “I can’t imagine what can go wrong” to “I can’t imagine what can go right.” Their pessimism wasn’t unfounded. As Marks told me in 2020, “This <span aria-label="page 69" id="page_69" role="doc-pagebreak"/>is a time when people are afraid of dying, they’re afraid of going out of their houses, and they’re afraid of a depression.” But their readiness to sell assets “at very low prices with urgency” provided him with a long-awaited opportunity. Amid the panic, Oaktree invested “a couple of billion dollars,” snapping up high-yield bonds that offered “a vast reward.”</p>
<p class="indent">The future had seldom seemed more unknowable or less inviting. Yet the investment risks had actually diminished. As Marks saw it, “The odds switched from precarious to propitious” for the simple reason that “things got cheap enough.”</p>
<p class="indent">The market then confounded expectations once more by staging the fastest rebound since the 1930s. So Marks “recalibrated” again, returning to a defensive posture as surging optimism caused the supply of bargains to dry up. His detached and unemotional behavior reflected perfectly the fundamental investment lesson he had drawn from Buddhism. Remember: <b>“We have to accommodate to the fact that the environment changes.”</b></p>
<h2 class="h2x">Find Order within Chaos</h2>
<p class="noindent">When I was in high school, I took an English literature exam that posed an unusually profound question: <i>The novelist Henry James wrote that life is “all inclusion and confusion,” while art is “all discrimination and selection.” Discuss.</i> As a writer, I love this idea that the artist’s mission is to find order within the all-inclusive confusion and muddle of life. James likened this search for hidden structure to a suspicious dog’s efforts to sniff out “some buried bone.”</p>
<p class="indent">The investor faces a similar challenge: life is endlessly confusing and complicated. But what if we could detect some underlying patterns within that infinitely complex web? Then, we might have more success in figuring out what the future has in store for us. Marks has a rare gift for identifying cyclical patterns that have occurred again and again in financial markets. Once we understand these patterns, we can avoid being blindsided by them and can even profit from them.</p>
<p class="indent">“It’s very helpful,” Marks tells me, “to view the world as behaving <span aria-label="page 70" id="page_70" role="doc-pagebreak"/>cyclically and oscillating, rather than going in some straight line.” He believes that almost everything is cyclical. For example, the economy expands and contracts; consumer spending waxes and wanes; corporate profitability rises and falls; the availability of credit eases and tightens; asset valuations soar and sink. Instead of continuing unabated in one direction, all of these phenomena eventually reverse course. He compares these patterns to the swinging of a pendulum from one extreme to the other.</p>
<p class="indent">The financial markets are the perfect laboratory for the study of cyclicality because they’re driven by investor psychology, which veers perennially between euphoria and despondency, greed and fear, credulousness and skepticism, complacency and terror. Humans get carried away, so the trend always overshoots in one direction or the other.</p>
<p class="indent">But Marks operates on the assumption that the cycle will eventually self-correct and the pendulum will swing back in the opposite direction. <b>The future may be unpredictable, but this recurring process of boom and bust is</b> <i>remarkably predictable</i><b>. Once we recognize this underlying pattern, we’re no longer flying blind.</b></p>
<p class="indent">The problem is, most investors act as if the latest market trend will continue indefinitely. Behavioral economists use the term <i>recency bias</i> to describe the cognitive glitch that leads us to overweight the importance of our recent experiences. Marks notes that the human mind also has a treacherous tendency to suppress painful memories. If this weren’t the case, I’m guessing that my wife wouldn’t have been willing to endure more than one pregnancy, and I’m not sure how many writers could muster the strength to keep returning to the blank screen. In our financial lives, this life-enhancing ability to forget unpleasant experiences is less helpful because the woes and mishaps of the past tend to provide the most valuable lessons.</p>
<p class="indent">One way to combat this costly tendency to forget is through intensive study of market history. <b>“You can’t know the future,” says Marks, but “it helps to know the past.”</b></p>
<p class="indent">He pulls from a bookshelf his inscribed copy of Galbraith’s book <i>A Short History of Financial Euphoria</i> and reads me his single favorite piece of financial writing, which explores the causes of market euphoria: “The first [cause] is the extreme brevity of the financial memory. <span aria-label="page 71" id="page_71" role="doc-pagebreak"/>In consequence, financial disaster is quickly forgotten. In further consequence, when the same or closely similar circumstances arise again, sometimes in only a few years, they are hailed by a new, often youthful, and always supremely self-confident generation as a brilliantly innovative discovery in the financial and larger economic world. There can be few fields of human endeavor in which history counts for so little as in the world of finance. Past experience, to the extent that it is part of memory at all, is dismissed as the primitive refuge of those who do not have the insight to appreciate the incredible wonders of the present.”</p>
<p class="indent">Watching the meteoric rise in the price of Bitcoin in 2017, Marks wondered if this was just the latest in a long history of incredible wonders that would prove less than wondrous. Likewise, he could never bring himself to bet that thrilling stocks such as Tesla and Netflix would continue to soar to infinity and beyond: “When things or people are successful, it usually brings in hubris, overexpansion, a belief that we can’t miss, which is very dangerous.” He always assumes that the pendulum will eventually swing in the opposite direction, just as it did for the “superstocks” that dominated previous bull markets. It’s easier to detect such excesses when you’ve seen a similar movie many times before, he says, “so you should try to get old.”</p>
<p class="indent">You should also try to read widely. François-Marie Wojcik, the doubt-filled French investor I mentioned earlier, showed me an 1891 novel by Émile Zola, <i>L’Argent</i> (Money), which depicts a speculative frenzy on the Paris stock exchange in the 1860s. Zola provides an oddly familiar account of a disastrous bubble that ends in a banking collapse, even detailing how “popular infatuation” drives a stock beyond its “maximum value” to a point where it will inevitably fall.</p>
<p class="indent">For Wojcik, a passionate student of history, Zola’s novel provides an early example of these “permanent” patterns of wayward crowd behavior. “Individually we’re smart,” says Wojcik. “Collectively, we’re stupid.” As a precaution, he stress tests his opinions constantly in order to reaffirm (or dismantle) his convictions: “I need to say, ‘François, are you <i>sure</i> about this investment this morning? Let me check again.’ ” He has a wonderful French phrase to describe his neurotically watchful mind-set: <i>toujours rester en éveil</i>. “Always stay awake.”</p>
<p class="indent">Marks, too, never lets down his guard. Most investors grow compla<span aria-label="page 72" id="page_72" role="doc-pagebreak"/>cent when times are good. If anything, his vigilance intensifies because he knows that everything changes, that the pendulum will not stop at one end of its arc, that “cycles eventually prevail.” As Marks explains, the risk is highest when risk tolerance is most extreme—a paradox that he calls “the perversity of risk.”</p>
<p class="indent">Marks spends much of his time analyzing the mood and behavior of other financial players, looking to deduce where the markets stand in their cycle. He’s particularly proud of a memo he wrote in 2007, a year before the financial crisis, that identified a slew of danger signs. These included idiotically loose lending standards for mortgages in the United States and the UK, a carefree willingness to finance undeserving companies, and a readiness to invest in risky bonds without covenant protections. Writing for emphasis in bold letters, he cautioned that <b>“times of laxness have always been followed eventually by corrections in which penalties are imposed.”</b></p>
<p class="indent">One way that Marks gauges the current investment environment is by gathering “vignettes” about “stupid deals” that are getting done. For example, in 2017, Argentina issued a hundred-year bond with an annual yield of 9 percent. It was vastly oversubscribed, even though Argentina had defaulted on its debt <i>eight</i> times in two hundred years, most recently in 2014. It seemed a fine example of what Samuel Johnson called “the triumph of hope over experience.” Sure enough, when I interviewed Marks in 2020, he noted that Argentina had just defaulted for the <i>ninth</i> time.</p>
<p class="indent">The symptoms of stupidity, overconfidence, greed, and low standards were particularly glaring in the run-up to the global financial crisis. Marks and his partner, Karsh, would compare notes and exclaim, “Look at this piece of crap! A deal like this shouldn’t be able to get done—and the fact that it <i>can</i> get done means there’s something wrong in the market.”</p>
<p class="indent">Such observations give Marks an impressionistic view of the market, not a numerical one. “All my processes are intuitive, instinctual, gut,” he says. “I just try to develop a sense. What’s really going on in the world? And what are the important inferences from what you can observe?”</p>
<p class="indent">To arrive at a conclusion, he asks himself questions such as <i>Are</i> <span aria-label="page 73" id="page_73" role="doc-pagebreak"/><i>investors appropriately skeptical and risk averse or are they ignoring risks and happily paying up? Are valuations reasonable relative to historical standards? Are deal structures fair to investors? Is there too much faith in the future?</i></p>
<p class="indent">In a sense, says Marks, he’s trying to “predict the present”—because, unlike the future, the present is knowable. What <i>isn’t</i> knowable is when the cycle will turn. “I don’t even think about the timing,” he says. “In the investment business, it’s very hard to do the right thing, and it’s impossible to do the right thing at the right time.”</p>
<p class="indent">The benefit of recognizing where we stand in the cycle is that it enables him to chart an appropriate course based on prevailing conditions, much as he’d drive more carefully on an icy road at night than on a sunny afternoon. “We have to recognize the market for what it is, accept it, and act accordingly,” says Marks. For example, when rich returns have made investors less afraid of losing money than missing out on lush gains, that’s a signal to lower our expectations and proceed with caution. What does that entail in practical terms? It might involve shifting some assets from stocks to bonds, buying less aggressive stocks, or making sure that you won’t need liquidity in the event that it suddenly disappears. “I’m not saying go to cash,” says Marks. “All I’m saying is, if the value proposition in the market changes, your portfolio should change.”</p>
<p class="indent">To my mind, there’s profound wisdom in this approach of seeing reality as it is, accepting it, and adapting to it. <b>As Marks often says, “The environment is what it is.” We can’t</b> <span class="bolditalic">demand</span> <b>a more favorable set of market conditions. But we</b> <span class="bolditalic">can</span> <b>control our response, turning more defensive or aggressive depending on the climate.</b></p>
<p class="indent">This go-with-the-flow attitude grows directly out of the teachings on impermanence that Marks had studied at college. “You know change is going to occur despite your attempts to resist it,” he says. “I think it should make you ease up and say, ‘I’m not going to try to control the future. I’m not going to know the future. I’m going to try to prepare for an uncertain future.’ ” Investors often land themselves in trouble when there’s a disconnect between their environment and their behavior—when they ignore or reject reality.</p>
<p class="indent">In a 2006 memo, Marks quoted the ancient Taoist philosopher Lao-<span aria-label="page 74" id="page_74" role="doc-pagebreak"/>tzu: “To be strong, you have to be like water: if there are no obstacles, it flows; if there is an obstacle, it stops; if a dam is broken, then it flows further; if a vessel is square, then it has a square form; if a vessel is round, then it has a round form. Because it is so soft and flexible, it is the most necessary and the strongest thing.” For an investor, too, it’s a strength to be like water, adjusting to whatever we encounter. It sounds so simple, but human nature conspires to make it difficult. Almost all of us are swayed by the mood of the crowd, and we struggle most to act rationally in extreme situations when the stakes are highest.</p>
<p class="indent">When markets crashed in 2008, the investment herd panicked, as it always does. Celebration turned to horror as cyclicality reasserted itself with a vengeance. How did Marks respond? He provided a master class in assessing and reacting to his environment with clear-eyed logic—and he led his company to pull off the investment coup of a lifetime.</p>
<h2 class="h2x">“Most of the Time, the End of the World Doesn’t Happen”</h2>
<p class="noindent">Months before the credit crisis arrived, Oaktree was already prepared for chaos. In early 2008, when most of the world was bullish and complacent, the firm completed the raising of $10.9 billion in assets to create the biggest distressed debt fund in history.</p>
<p class="indent">Of all the cycles Marks has studied, none seems to him more predictable than the credit cycle. As he explains in <i>The Most Important Thing</i>, “Prosperity brings expanded lending, which leads to unwise lending, which produces large losses, which makes lenders stop lending, which ends prosperity, and on and on.” He’d witnessed years of foolish lending from 2003 to 2007. When the inevitable losses piled up and lending screeched to a halt, he intended to profit from the distress. There’s nothing quite like having cash when others are gasping for it.</p>
<p class="indent">The credit crisis began with the sick joke of subprime mortgages and then metastasized. Mortgage lending froze. House prices tumbled. Commercial property prices tanked. Bear Stearns collapsed. Improbable disasters became a daily occurrence.</p>
<p class="indent">Writing to Oaktree’s shareholders on July 31, 2008, Marks reported that he still saw a shortage of beaten-down assets and suggested “going <span aria-label="page 75" id="page_75" role="doc-pagebreak"/>slow” until better bargains came along. Within weeks, the financial system began to disintegrate. In September, the US government seized control of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac; Merrill Lynch was forced to sell itself to Bank of America; Lehman announced the largest bankruptcy filing in US history; AIG had to be rescued with an $85 billion government loan; even Goldman Sachs was hanging over the abyss.</p>
<p class="indent">It was the greatest panic Marks had ever seen. But as the markets plunged and pessimism exploded, he turned bullish for the first time in years. On September 15, the day Lehman died, Oaktree began to amass an immense hoard of busted assets that nobody else would touch. Over the next fifteen weeks, the firm—led by Marks and Karsh—invested an astounding $500 million to $600 million per week.</p>
<p class="indent">This was the bet of Marks’s career, the making or unmaking of his reputation. So you might imagine that he was certain of what he was doing. But when Lehman went under, it struck him that <i>nobody</i> knew what would happen.</p>
<p class="indent">On September 19, he wrote a memo to Oaktree’s clients that posed an unanswerable question, which somehow <i>had</i> to be answered: “Will the financial system melt down or is this merely the greatest down cycle we’ve ever seen? My answer is simple: we have no choice but to assume that this isn’t the end, but just another cycle to take advantage of.” With characteristic dry humor, he added, “Most of the time, the end of the world doesn’t happen.”</p>
<p class="indent">When I ask what made him shift his stance from defensive to aggressive in mid-September, Marks replies, “The world went to hell. Assets were being given away. Nobody had any faith that the world would even exist tomorrow, and there were no buyers for any assets.… It was a perfect storm of circumstances for disaster.”</p>
<p class="indent">Marks never thinks of the future as a single predetermined scenario that’s bound to occur. He views it instead as a “distribution of different possibilities.” His standard approach is to assign probabilities to each of these “alternative futures.” But in this case, the uncertainty was so extreme that there was no point even trying to assign probabilities for the array of possible outcomes. He found it more helpful to simplify his decision-making by thinking of the situation in binary terms: “I think you can reduce it to, either the world ends or it doesn’t.… And if it <span aria-label="page 76" id="page_76" role="doc-pagebreak"/>doesn’t end and we didn’t buy, then we didn’t do our job. That made it awfully straightforward.”</p>
<p class="indent">But as the markets continued to crash and financial pillars crumbled, few people agreed with him. Some of the best investors he knows were “just shell-shocked. They were saying, ‘It’s going to melt down.’ ” Marks knew how close we were to the edge. He could envision outcomes in which dominoes kept falling and we ended up with mass unemployment and societal disaster. “How bad is bad? You can’t say what the worst case could be. Anarchy, riots, starvation?”</p>
<p class="indent">Then, in mid-October, he had an unforgettable experience that strengthened his contrarian conviction. One of Oaktree’s funds made leveraged investments in high-yield debt, borrowing so that it could bet $5 for every dollar it held in equity capital. The fund owned senior loans that were relatively low risk: over the previous thirty years, Oaktree’s average default rate for debt of this type had been just 1 percent a year. But prices fell so far below historical norms that Oaktree now faced the threat of a margin call. Marks contacted clients and asked them to put up more equity, which enabled the fund to halve its leverage and avert the margin call. But prices kept plunging, so he had to ask them to contribute <i>more</i> money.</p>
<p class="indent">It should have been a no-brainer. If they didn’t step up, they’d lock in their losses at these catastrophic prices. But Marks met with a pension fund manager who kept asking what would happen to Oaktree’s bonds under more and more extreme circumstances. Each time Marks answered with a reassuring fact, he was met with the same panic-stricken response: “What if it’s worse than that?”</p>
<p class="indent">Marks raced back to his office and dashed off a memo titled “The Limits of Negativism.” As he contemplated that meeting, he had a revelation. For decades, he’d warned investors to maintain their skepticism when optimism was so abundant that no story was too good to be true. But pessimism had reached such dire levels that investors now acted as if “no story was too bad to be true.” For a rational skeptic, the point is not to be permanently pessimistic; it’s to question what “everyone” believes to be true, whether it’s too positive <i>or</i> too negative. Explaining his epiphany, he wrote: <b>“Skepticism calls for pessimism when optimism is excessive. But it also calls for optimism when pessimism is excessive.”</b></p>
<p class="indent"><span aria-label="page 77" id="page_77" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Thus Howard Marks, the eternal worrier, became virtually the only optimist on Wall Street.</p>
<p class="indent">Going against the crowd in the midst of “total panic” when “everyone’s convinced that things can only get worse” requires an uncommon level of intellectual clarity and imperturbability. But when I ask if he found the crisis painful, Marks replies flatly, “I don’t remember it being difficult.” Was he always unemotional? “Yeah.” Knowing that he’s been married twice, I wonder if this aspect of his character drives his wife crazy. “Yeah, especially my first wife,” he says. “I think I’ve done a better job with it more recently.”</p>
<p class="indent">It also helped that he and his Oaktree partner, Karsh, talked constantly, supporting each other and making sure they were moving at the right speed. While Marks provided guidance on the big picture, Karsh and his team did the nitty-gritty work of valuing assets. Two or three years earlier, private equity firms had used massive leverage to buy high-quality businesses at exorbitant valuations. Oaktree now bought the senior debt of these companies for a pittance. In some cases, Oaktree would break even if these businesses proved to be worth <i>one-fifth</i> of what the buyout firms had paid. “I always look at things in terms of ‘Where’s the mistake? Is the mistake in buying or not buying?’ ” says Marks. “It didn’t take an enormous leap of faith to conclude that these were good buys.”</p>
<p class="indent">The most spectacular score came from Oaktree’s $100 million investment in Pierre Foods, which it bought out of bankruptcy in 2008. Reborn as AdvancePierre Foods, it became a nationwide leader in packaged sandwiches and was acquired by Tyson Foods in 2017. Oaktree made about $2.2 billion over eight years—a twenty-three-fold gain on its invested capital.</p>
<p class="indent">In all, Oaktree wagered about $10 billion in the depths of the crisis. Marks estimates the gains from those investments at $9 billion—the biggest windfall in the company’s history. As its largest shareholders, nobody profited more than Marks and Karsh. But there was also the sheer pleasure of outthinking others and being right. As Marks says, “We have bet and we have won.”</p>
<h2 class="h2x"><span aria-label="page 78" id="page_78" role="doc-pagebreak"/>“The Question Is, Do You Push the Limits?”</h2>
<p class="noindent">In our conversations and in his writings, Marks returns repeatedly to a handful of themes that have obsessed him for decades. As I see it, five critical ideas come up again and again:</p>
<p class="indent"><b>The importance of admitting that we can’t predict or control the future.</b></p>
<p class="indent"><b>The benefits of studying the patterns of the past and using them as a rough guide to what could happen next.</b></p>
<p class="indent"><b>The inevitability that cycles will reverse and reckless excess will be punished.</b></p>
<p class="indent"><b>The possibility of turning cyclicality to our advantage by behaving countercyclically.</b></p>
<p class="indent"><b>The need for humility, skepticism, and prudence in order to achieve long-term financial success in an uncertain world.</b></p>
<p class="indent">Life is so complex that it’s useful to internalize a small core of simple and robust insights that can lend order to our diffuse thinking. All five of these ideas have tremendous utility for any investor looking to navigate the unknowable future.</p>
<p class="indent">But in synthesizing what I’ve learned from Marks, I can’t help thinking that one lesson in particular has such far-reaching implications that I need to make it central to my view of the world. For me, that tenet is the one he learned at college more than fifty years ago: everything is impermanent.</p>
<p class="indent">The financial markets provide us with many examples of this Buddhist teaching. The Asian “economic miracle” was followed by the Asian financial crisis of 1997; the dot-com mania of the late 1990s was followed by the crash of 2000; the housing bubble was followed by the credit crisis, which was followed by an epic bull market that began in 2009; then, in 2020, the market dropped 34 percent in twenty-three days before surging almost 40 percent in the weeks that followed.</p>
<p class="indent">If the Buddha had been a hedge fund manager, he might have pointed out that change itself is not ultimately the problem. Rather, we doom ourselves to suffer—both in investing and life—when we expect <span aria-label="page 79" id="page_79" role="doc-pagebreak"/>or yearn for things to stay the same. The real problem is this habit of clinging to or relying on what cannot last.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>As Buddhism teaches, we need to acknowledge the transience of all worldly phenomena so we won’t be surprised or dismayed when change occurs.</b> Shunryu Suzuki said, “If we cannot accept this teaching that everything changes, we cannot be in composure.”</p>
<p class="indent">Financially, the inevitability of change has important implications. For a start, we need to acknowledge that the current economic climate and market trajectory are temporary phenomena, just like everything else. So we should avoid positioning ourselves in such a way that we’re dependent on their continuing along the same path. As Marks notes, investors repeatedly make the mistake of overestimating the longevity of the market’s upswings and downturns; they forget that nothing lasts forever. Likewise, many home buyers ruined themselves during the financial crisis by taking on too much debt in the belief that house prices would continue to rise from here to eternity. The moral? <b>Never bet the farm against the inexorable forces of change.</b></p>
    <p class="indent">The recognition that all things are transient can fill you with a destabilizing sense that your life (and everything you cherish) is hopelessly precarious. It’s tempting to live in denial. But it’s prudent to acknowledge that we’re skating on thin ice and can never be sure when it might crack. This awareness doesn’t mean that we should hide at home forever—or that we should sit permanently on cash, refusing to take any risk. <b>Both in markets and life, the goal isn’t to embrace risk</b> <span class="bolditalic">or</span> <b>eschew it, but to bear it intelligently while never forgetting the possibility of an unpleasant outcome.</b></p>
<p class="indent">It’s not an easy balance to achieve. In the darkest days of 2008, Marks had to keep reminding himself to resist his tendency to worry: “If I overdo it, then I’m not doing my job for my clients because they didn’t hire me to be a chicken. They want me to be a safe investor, but not a chicken.” When taken too far, he adds, “risk avoidance” condemns you to “return avoidance.”</p>
<p class="indent">Fortunately, we’re not powerless in the face of change. There are many ways to make ourselves less vulnerable. Instead of trying to predict the unpredictable, Marks suggests that we focus on building “unfragile portfolios and unfragile lives” that are unlikely to collapse even in dire <span aria-label="page 80" id="page_80" role="doc-pagebreak"/>conditions.<sup class="sup"><a href="footnotes.xhtml#footnote-039" id="footnote-039-backlink">VI</a></sup> What does that mean for regular investors? “Avoid a lot of debt and leverage,” and don’t let your dreams of a “bonanza” lead you to “expose yourself to the possibility of a catastrophe,” he says. <b>“Not trying to maximize is an important component in preparing for what life may throw at you, and that’s true in investing and living. So the question is, do you push the limits?”</b></p>
<p class="indent">That question applies not just to investing, but to spending. “Financial independence doesn’t come from making or having a lot of money,” says Marks. “You know what it comes from? Spending less than you make. Living within your means. It’s important to know that your antifragility comes from the extent to which you are not at the limit.”</p>
<p class="indent">The trouble is, we tend to forget this when we’re thriving—or when we’re watching others thrive while we lag behind. So we edge closer to our limits and eventually stray beyond them.</p>
<p class="indent">Marks adds that we also need to recognize our financial and psychological fragility. “You <i>better</i> be scared—scared in the sense of acknowledging the possibility of bad things happening and being realistic about your own ability to withstand bad outcomes.” He warns against “macho” claims that we won’t mind if the stock market plunges: “What normally happens when it goes down a third is that people panic and they sell and they turn that downward fluctuation into a permanent loss, which is the worst thing you can do.”</p>
<p class="indent">It’s vital, then, to be honest with ourselves about how much risk we can handle: “If you take on too much, it will overwhelm your emotional resilience and you will be forced to do the wrong thing even if nothing else transpires against you—like a margin call or a need to buy bread.”</p>
<p class="indent">There’s a Buddhist quality to this habit of seeing reality as it is, without aversion or self-delusion. One of the greatest texts of Buddhism is the <i>Satipatthana Sutta</i>, the Buddha’s discourse on mindfulness as a means to nirvana. He explains that the path to awakening requires us to become “ever mindful” of whatever presents itself to us—to observe with detachment as all things (including our thoughts, feelings, and <span aria-label="page 81" id="page_81" role="doc-pagebreak"/>sensory perceptions) arise and pass away. Freedom comes from “clearly knowing” that everything is ephemeral and training ourselves to stop grasping at what is inherently unstable. The Buddha repeats the same refrain thirteen times: “And one abides independent, not clinging to anything in the world.”</p>
<p class="indent">This idea of nonattachment can sound cold or unnatural. But a recognition of impermanence has its benefits. For one, it’s not just the good stuff (our youthful beauty, our loved ones, economic booms, and bull markets) that will fade away. The bad stuff (emotional and physical pain, lousy political leaders, recessions, and pandemics) will also pass. Given that everything changes, we shouldn’t get too carried away when times are good or too despondent when they’re bad.</p>
<p class="indent">A sense of impermanence can also inspire us to value and nurture our relationships (since we don’t know how long any of us will be here) and to live more fully now. In his book <i>The Science of Enlightenment</i>, Shinzen Young writes of learning to experience the world with “radical fullness” by focusing on every moment with “extraordinary concentration, sensory clarity, and equanimity.… You can dramatically extend life—not by multiplying the number of your years, but by expanding the fullness of your moments.”<sup class="sup"><a href="footnotes.xhtml#footnote-038" id="footnote-038-backlink">VII</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Now in his seventies, Marks has a keen sense of his own impermanence. His father lived to 101, so he may have inherited a genetic edge. Even so, he knows that the odds are against his being immortal. At this stage of life, he reflects increasingly on whether he’s conducted himself admirably—not least, in the way he’s treated colleagues and clients. “What you accomplish in life is not the only important thing. It’s also important <i>how</i> you do it,” he says. “Maybe I’m insecure. But to me, it’s very important that I’m acknowledged to have led a good life.” He delights in Oaktree’s returns, but he’s also proud of its reputation for integrity and of his relationship with his cofounder, Karsh. Marks says they’ve never argued in three decades of working together.</p>
<p class="indent"><span aria-label="page 82" id="page_82" role="doc-pagebreak"/>What does he hope to achieve in the years to come? “I don’t have any grand ambitions,” says Marks. “My life is terrific. I want to be a good husband, father, grandfather. And I want to keep seeing things in the investment world that other people don’t see and describing them clearly for my clients.”</p>
<p class="indent">He plans to work indefinitely because he finds it intellectually rewarding, not because he has an “unquenchable” thirst for money or status. He recalls his Japanese studies professor explaining a Buddhist teaching that “you have to break the chain of getting and wanting”—an aimless cycle of craving that leads inevitably to suffering. Perhaps.
