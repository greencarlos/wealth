<p class="chepi">Our life is frittered away by detail.… Simplify, simplify.</p>
<p class="chepiatt">—Henry David Thoreau</p>

<p class="noindent">The humidity is stifling. On summer days like this, even the hardiest New Yorkers fantasize about escaping from the heat trapped between the city’s skyscrapers. Down on Wall Street, the aspiring plutocrats buttoned up in their formal business suits must be gasping for air.</p>
<p class="indent">One hundred miles away, Joel Greenblatt has taken refuge from the city and is working at his beach house in the Hamptons today. We’re seated in the shade of his elegantly furnished patio, savoring the cool breeze and his magnificent view of the Atlantic. The house has a swimming pool with a basketball hoop and a lawn with soccer goalposts. A couple of surfboards lean against a wall behind us. Sunlight shimmers on the ocean’s surface.</p>
<p class="indent">Suntanned and relaxed, Greenblatt is dressed in jeans and black leather loafers without socks. His sleeves are rolled up. A keen ten<span aria-label="page 110" id="page_110" role="doc-pagebreak"/>nis player, he looks trim and fit on the brink of his sixtieth birthday. The giants of investing are not always endowed with an abundance of social skills. But Greenblatt, a giant among giants, has a beguiling manner and a warm smile. Above all, there’s a quiet confidence and poise about him—a sense that he is beyond the usual craving for approval. He’s comfortable with who he is, secure in the knowledge of all that he’s achieved.</p>
<p class="indent">Perhaps that’s not surprising, given the extent of his accomplishments. Greenblatt’s investment returns are the stuff of legend. In 1985, at the tender age of twenty-seven, he founded Gotham Capital and launched a hedge fund with assets of about $7 million. In 1989, he was joined by Robert Goldstein, who remains his partner three decades later. In its first ten years, the fund scored returns of 50 percent a year (after expenses but before fees). Over twenty years, it averaged an astonishing 40 percent a year. At that rate, $1 million grows to $836 million—a nifty trick.</p>
<p class="indent">After five years, Gotham returned half of its investors’ money. After ten, it returned the rest, so that Greenblatt and Goldstein could concentrate on managing their own fortunes. Most fund managers are vulnerable to their shareholders’ whims. But they had the ultimate luxury of being answerable to nobody.</p>
<p class="indent">Free to pursue his curiosity wherever it took him, Greenblatt forged an unpredictable path. Many of the best investors have narrow interests, since excellence demands focus. But Greenblatt has led a rich and varied life. For a start, he’s an enthusiastic family man with a wife, five kids, and two dogs. He’s also an annoyingly talented writer. He’s published three investment books, which are filled with his unique blend of granular advice, irreverent wisecracks (“<i>Note</i>: There are three kinds of people—those who can count and those who can’t”), exuberant wordplay (<i>ipso facto</i> is spelled <i>ipso fatso</i>), and amusing tales of his youthful misadventures involving imitation dog vomit and underage bets at the greyhound racetrack.<sup class="sup"><a href="footnotes.xhtml#footnote-029" id="footnote-029-backlink">I</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent"><span aria-label="page 111" id="page_111" role="doc-pagebreak"/>His first book, <i>You Can Be a Stock Market Genius (Even If You’re Not Too Smart!)</i> was intended for a general audience, but became a bible for hedge fund managers in search of an edge. His second, <i>The Little Book That Beats the Market</i>, was designed to demystify investing for his children, but sold more than three hundred thousand copies and was hailed by Michael Price as “one of the most important investment books of the last fifty years.” His third book, <i>The Big Secret for the Small Investor</i>, fared less well. Greenblatt jokes that “it’s still a secret” because “no one read it.”</p>
<p class="indent">Since 1996, he has also taught the course “Value and Special Situation Investment” at Columbia Business School. So far, he’s instructed an elite cohort of around eight hundred MBA students, sharing with them the intellectual framework that enabled him to beat the market. Greenblatt begins the course by informing them that the skills he’s about to teach can make them extremely rich, but he warns that this pursuit has about as much social value as a knack for handicapping horses. With that caveat in mind, he asks them to “find some way to give back.”</p>
<p class="indent">Writing and teaching have provided Greenblatt with two rewarding ways of giving back. In a field that’s rife with self-serving and misguided advice that may be hazardous to your financial health, he has followed in the grand tradition of Ben Graham, Warren Buffett, and Howard Marks by sharing investment wisdom that has demonstrably worked. Meanwhile, as a philanthropist, Greenblatt has also played an instrumental role in creating a network of forty-five free, public charter schools that serve eighteen thousand students across New York City. Most come from low-income and minority households in areas such as the Bronx and Harlem.</p>
<p class="indent">In recent years, Greenblatt has also returned to managing outside money. He and Goldstein have created a family of long/short mutual funds, which represent an intriguing and unexpected departure from the strategy that propelled them to stardom. Greenblatt, who has a strong entrepreneurial streak, loves starting new ventures. But his underlying ambition isn’t to maximize his own wealth by building a financial empire. “I have nothing against making money,” he says. “But it’s not really what drives me. I have enough.”</p>
<p class="indent">Rather, he’s motivated primarily by a game player’s delight in devis<span aria-label="page 112" id="page_112" role="doc-pagebreak"/>ing ingenious ways to win. “It’s the fun of the challenge of figuring things out that I’m most attracted to,” he says. “And since everyone else in the world is trying to figure it out, it’s a nice feeling to solve the puzzle.” Indeed, I see Greenblatt as a kind of code breaker who is drawn inexorably to the intellectual challenge of beating the system.</p>
<p class="indent">I wanted to understand what he had discovered in more than three decades of attempting to decrypt the market and outwit the competition. As I would soon learn, the principles underpinning his strategies are surprisingly simple. In fact, what makes Greenblatt such an illuminating guide to investing is his gift for reducing this complex game to its purest essence. For example, during a conversation at his office in midtown Manhattan, he tells me that the entire secret of successful stock picking comes down to this: “Figure out what something is worth and pay a lot less.”</p>
<p class="indent">Is it really that straightforward? Well, we shall see.</p>
<p class="indent">But first, let’s take a brief detour to explain why it’s so important to identify a few fundamental principles that are, at least, approximately true. Then, with help from Greenblatt and some other financial titans, we’ll narrow everything down to a handful of specific investment principles that should help us to stay on track for decades to come. The goal? In this overcomplicated world of ours, we are searching for a simple, logical, and dependable path to superior returns.</p>
<h2 class="h2x">The Simplicity That Lies on the Other Side of Complexity</h2>
<p class="noindent">Growing up in London in the 1970s, I could choose from a grand total of three television channels. I still remember the magical evening in 1982 when my motherland was blessed by the miraculous arrival of Channel 4, which promised to deliver a limitless feast of televisual wonders. Nowadays, in twenty-first-century New York, I have at least one hundred channels. Yet I can seldom be bothered to switch on my TV, except for the reliable disappointment of watching England’s soccer team getting knocked out of the World Cup every four years.</p>
<p class="indent">We often assume that additional choices will make us happier. Up to a point, it may even be true. But I’m hardly alone in finding all of this <span aria-label="page 113" id="page_113" role="doc-pagebreak"/>added complexity overwhelming. The psychologist Barry Schwartz argues in <i>The Paradox of Choice: Why More Is Less</i> that many shoppers become paralyzed by the first world problem of supermarket shelves heaving under the weight of twenty-four types of gourmet jam.</p>
<p class="indent">When it comes to investing, the proliferation of choices can make your head spin. Should you buy individual stocks, ETFs, hedge funds, or mutual funds? Actively managed funds or index funds? Should you favor one investment style or mix and match among such categories as growth, value, growth at a reasonable price, deep value, momentum, macro, or market neutral? And how should you divide your money between domestic and foreign stocks, bonds, cash, and “alternatives” such as private equity, venture capital, REITs, gold, and pork-belly futures?</p>
<p class="indent">In practical terms, the ability to reduce complexity is immensely valuable. Just think for a moment about the Old Testament, which contains no fewer than 613 commandments. Who can remember so many rules, let alone obey them all? Maybe that’s why we needed a top ten list. But when I tried to jot down the Ten Commandments just now, I got only six of them right—and that was with the assistance of some dishonest grading.</p>
<p class="indent">Still, I <i>do</i> remember this: About two thousand years ago, a sage named Hillel was asked to teach the entire Old Testament while standing on one leg. He replied, “What is hateful to you, do not do to your neighbor. All the rest is commentary.” The Old Testament requires just three words to convey this overriding rule: <i>Veahavta lereacha kamocha</i>, which is translated from the Hebrew as “And you shall love your neighbor as yourself.”</p>
<p class="indent">Likewise, when Jesus was asked about the most important of all the commandments, he opted for deep simplicity, declaring, “Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbor as thyself.”</p>
<p class="indent">I’m also partial to this wonderfully concise exhortation from the Buddha: “Refrain from what is unwholesome. Do good. Purify the mind.” As an instruction manual for life, how much more do we need than those ten words? Like Hillel and Jesus, the Buddha presumably recognized that we lesser mortals are acutely vulnerable to confusion in the face of complexity—and that a minimal number of sim<span aria-label="page 114" id="page_114" role="doc-pagebreak"/>ple, memorable guideposts can steer us pretty effectively in the general direction of nirvana.</p>
<p class="indent">Simplification is an equally important strategy in more worldly realms such as science and business. For example, scientists often invoke the Occam’s razor principle, which is attributed to a fourteenth-century English friar and philosopher named William of Occam. His principle holds that “all things being equal, the simplest solution tends to be the best one.”</p>
<p class="indent">Occam’s image of a razor captures the critical notion that we’re more likely to find the right answer by shaving away all unnecessary details. Albert Einstein agreed, observing, “All physical theories, their mathematical expressions apart, ought to lend themselves to so simple a description that even a child could understand them.” Lord Ernest Rutherford, the father of nuclear physics, reached a similar conclusion, reputedly remarking, “If a piece of physics cannot be explained to a barmaid, then it is not a good piece of physics.”<sup class="sup"><a href="footnotes.xhtml#footnote-028" id="footnote-028-backlink">II</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Simplicity also plays an important role in many of the most successful businesses. Take the Google home page, which consists primarily of a logo and a pill-shaped space in which to type your search words. Or consider the sleek, uncluttered elegance that Steve Jobs—inspired by the minimalist esthetic of Zen Buddhism—brought to Apple’s products. As Jobs often explained, his devotion to simplicity went far beyond design: “The way we’re running the company, the product design, the advertising, it all comes down to this: ‘Let’s make it simple. Really simple.’ ” As far back as 1977, the company’s first marketing brochure featured a photograph of a shiny red apple under the tagline “Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.”<sup class="sup"><a href="footnotes.xhtml#footnote-027" id="footnote-027-backlink">III</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent"><span aria-label="page 115" id="page_115" role="doc-pagebreak"/>The financial services industry tends <i>not</i> to favor simplicity—hence the rise of mind-boggling “innovations” such as collateralized debt obligations, structured investment vehicles, and credit default swaps, which came close to destroying the global economy in 2008. The late Jack Bogle, who founded the Vanguard Group in 1975 and created the first index fund a year later, observed in a book titled <i>Enough</i>, “Financial institutions operate by a kind of <i>reverse</i> Occam’s razor. They have a large incentive to favor the complex and costly over the simple and cheap, quite the opposite of what most investors need and ought to want.”<sup class="sup"><a href="footnotes.xhtml#footnote-026" id="footnote-026-backlink">IV</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">When I interviewed Bogle in 2001, he pointed out that nothing could have been simpler than his theory that low-cost index funds would beat actively managed funds as a group, since the latter would be burdened by higher operating expenses and transaction costs. “When there’s a financial intermediary—a croupier—it takes a lot out of the market return,” he told me. “So index funds <i>have</i> to win. It was not complicated.” That elementary insight into the mathematical advantages of index funds proved so powerful that Vanguard’s assets have since grown to $6.2 trillion.<sup class="sup"><a href="footnotes.xhtml#footnote-025" id="footnote-025-backlink">V</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">One of the most thoughtful proponents of simplicity is Josh Waitzkin, an expert on peak performance in fields as diverse as chess, martial arts, and investing. As a child prodigy, he was a national chess <span aria-label="page 116" id="page_116" role="doc-pagebreak"/>champion and the subject of the movie <i>Searching for Bobby Fischer</i>. As an adult, he became a world champion in tai chi chuan push hands, a coach to hedge fund managers, and the author of a fascinating book, <i>The Art of Learning: An Inner Journey to Optimal Performance</i>.</p>
<p class="indent">Based on his own experience as a world-class performer, Waitzkin stresses the importance of breaking down complicated challenges into simple components. When teaching chess, he would remove all but three pieces (two kings and one pawn) as a way of exploring the game’s essential principles in a context of reduced complexity. Similarly, he mastered tai chi by “incrementally refining the simplest of movements—for example pushing your hands six inches through the air.” By obsessively practicing such “simplified motions,” he gradually internalized the underlying principles of the entire martial art, such as “the coordination of mind, breath, and body.” He concludes, “It is rarely a mysterious technique that drives us to the top, but rather a profound mastery of what may well be a basic skill set.”</p>
<p class="indent">This is a crucial insight that can benefit even the smartest investors. After all, complexity can be a particularly seductive trap for clever people. They were rewarded at school for solving complex problems, so it’s no surprise if they are drawn to complicated solutions when confronted by the puzzle of investing. But in financial markets, as in martial arts, victory doesn’t depend on dazzling displays of esoteric techniques. It depends on a firm grasp of the principles of the game and a deep mastery of basic skills. As Buffett has said, “Business schools reward difficult, complex behavior more than simple behavior. But simple behavior is more effective.”</p>
<p class="indent">Buffett himself is a grand master of simplification. Writing to his shareholders in 1977, he laid out his four criteria for selecting any stock: “We want the business to be (1) one that we can understand, (2) with favorable long-term prospects, (3) operated by honest and competent people, and (4) available at a very attractive price.” These may not strike you as earth-shattering secrets. But it’s hard to beat this distillation of eternal truths about what makes a stock desirable. More than forty years have passed, yet Buffett’s four filters remain as relevant and useful as ever.</p>
<p class="indent">I’ve been struck again and again by the ability of the best investors to <span aria-label="page 117" id="page_117" role="doc-pagebreak"/>condense many years of learning into a few key principles. This isn’t a matter of dumbing things down or pretending that complications and contradictions don’t exist. It’s about synthesizing the details of an endlessly rich and nuanced subject, then crunching it down into an irreducible essence. This reminds me of a remark that’s often attributed to the Supreme Court justice Oliver Wendell Holmes: “For the simplicity that lies this side of complexity, I would not give a fig, but for the simplicity that lies on the other side of complexity, I would give my life.”<sup class="sup"><a href="footnotes.xhtml#footnote-024" id="footnote-024-backlink">VI</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Why is it so valuable to reduce investing to a few core principles? For a start, it forces us to think through what we truly believe. These convictions are especially useful in tempestuous times when we’re barraged by uncertainty, doubt, and fear. Just think how disoriented we felt in the early months of 2020 when COVID-19 killed more than one hundred thousand people in the United States alone, threw tens of million into unemployment, and drove the market down by a third in a matter of weeks.</p>
<p class="indent">But it’s almost as easy to get knocked off course in the best of times. There’s so much anxiety-inducing noise in the news; so many competing sales pitches from hawkers of awful investment products and dubious expertise; so many temptations to switch to whatever fashionable strategy or overheated asset class seems to be making everyone else ludicrously rich.</p>
<p class="indent">The best investors have the discipline not to be swayed by such distractions. As Greenblatt says, “I have a simple way of looking at things that makes sense to me and that I’m going to stick with through thick and thin. That’s it.”</p>
<h2 class="h2x">Will Danoff’s Secret Sauce</h2>
<p class="noindent">The virtues of a simple, deeply held investment credo struck me with particular force when I interviewed Will Danoff at the Boston head<span aria-label="page 118" id="page_118" role="doc-pagebreak"/>quarters of Fidelity Investments. There’s nothing slick or showy about Danoff, a genial workaholic with a gap-toothed grin and a wry sense of humor. He looks more like a rumpled, sleep-deprived middle manager than a Master of the Universe. Still, since taking charge of the Fidelity Contrafund in 1990, he has built it into a colossus with about $118 billion in assets, making it America’s largest actively managed fund run by a single person. In all, he manages more than $200 billion.</p>
<p class="indent">It’s notoriously difficult to outperform the market with a huge fund. But when we met in 2017, Danoff had the remarkable distinction of having whipped the S&amp;P 500 over one, three, five, ten, and twenty-seven years. I was eager to uncover the subtle ingredients of his secret sauce. But he managed to sum up his entire investment philosophy in three words: “Stocks follow earnings.”</p>
<p class="indent">With that principle in mind, he searches with relentless drive for “best-of-breed businesses” that he thinks will “grow to be bigger in five years.” Why? Because if a company doubles its earnings per share in the next five years, he believes the stock price is also likely to double (more or less). This generalization is easy to dismiss because it sounds suspiciously simplistic. But remember: investing isn’t like Olympic diving, where the judges award extra points for difficulty.</p>
<p class="indent">Danoff is unapologetic about his single-minded focus on predicting earnings growth. Unlike most of the investors in this book, he doesn’t even worry that much about valuation levels, except when they get “ridiculous.” He asks, “Do you want to win the game for shareholders and own great companies? Sometimes, to own a great company, you’ve got to pay a fair price.”</p>
<p class="indent">This mindset has led him to amass enormous, long-held positions in dominant, well-managed businesses such as Berkshire Hathaway (a major holding since 1996), Microsoft, Alphabet (he was one of the largest investors in Google’s 2004 IPO and has held it ever since), Amazon (his biggest position), and Facebook (he was among the biggest buyers in the IPO). “This is pretty basic stuff,” he says. “My attitude with investing is, Why not invest with the best?”</p>
<p class="indent">To explain his way of thinking, Danoff shows me a stack of tattered and coffee-stained notes that provide a partial record of his meetings with tens of thousands of companies over the past three decades. He <span aria-label="page 119" id="page_119" role="doc-pagebreak"/>pulls out one of his favorite mementos: two pages of his messy, handwritten scribblings from a meeting with Howard Schultz, the visionary who transformed Starbucks into a global brand. They met in June 1992—exactly one week before the company went public with a market value of $250 million. These days, Starbucks is valued at about $120 billion.</p>
<p class="indent">Looking over his notes from that meeting, Danoff tells me, “Everything you needed to know was laid out here. There was a huge opportunity.” For example, Schultz pointed out that Italy alone had at least 200,000 coffee bars. By comparison, Starbucks had 139. But the Seattle-based company was aggressively expanding into other cities, opening new cafés at a modest cost of about $250,000 apiece. In its third year, a café could generate $150,000 in profits—a 60 percent return on the initial investment. “The key,” says Danoff, “is that the return on each store was quite high,” so the company “could grow at a fast pace without needing external financing.”</p>
<p class="indent">Danoff says he didn’t appreciate Schultz when they first met. But Starbucks would ultimately become one of the Contrafund’s largest holdings. Along the way, the company would provide the perfect illustration of why it’s so valuable to invest for the long run in great businesses that sustain an unusually high growth rate. Danoff points to a chart that tracks the company’s stupendous performance over two decades: its earnings per share grew by 27.45 percent annually for twenty years, while the stock soared by 21.32 percent a year. Over the same period, the S&amp;P 500’s earnings grew by 8.4 percent a year, while the index rose just 7.9 percent a year.</p>
<p class="indent">Danoff runs a finger along the fever lines on his chart and asks me what lesson they demonstrate. I reply, “The stock price is eventually going to follow the earnings.” His eyes open wide and he flashes me a joyous smile: “Exactly! Bingo! <i>That’s</i> what I’ve learned. <i>Stocks follow earnings!</i>”</p>
<p class="indent">His mantra doesn’t sound particularly profound. But Danoff’s edge lies partly in his consistent refusal to overcomplicate. His friend Bill Miller, one of the most insightful thinkers in investing, says Danoff consciously focuses on the questions that matter most, instead of getting tangled up in distracting details: “Will once said to me, falsely, ‘Look, I’m not that smart and there’s a lot of information out there. So when I look at a company, I just ask myself: “Are things getting better or <span aria-label="page 120" id="page_120" role="doc-pagebreak"/>are they getting worse?” If they’re getting better, then I want to understand what’s going on.’ ”</p>
<p class="indent">Miller, too, has learned to simplify his investment process. “I’m trying to get rid of the unnecessary parts of what I used to do,” he says. For example, he used to build elaborate financial models in an attempt to grasp the complexities of each company he was analyzing. “I don’t build models anymore. It’s just stupid. It doesn’t make any sense.” Instead, he concentrates on three or four critical issues that he believes will drive the business. “For every company, there are a few key investment variables,” he says, “and the rest of the stuff is noise.”</p>
<p class="indent">The pattern is clear. In their own ways, Greenblatt, Buffett, Bogle, Danoff, and Miller have all been seekers of simplicity. The rest of us should follow suit. <b>We each need a simple and consistent investment strategy that works well over time—one that we understand and believe in strongly enough that we’ll adhere to it faithfully through good times and bad.</b> We’ll return to this idea later because it’s so important. But for now, let’s delve deeper into Greenblatt’s mind and find out what he figured out about how to solve the puzzle of investing.</p>
<h2 class="h2x">Efficient Markets, Crazy People, and Dynamite</h2>
<p class="noindent">When Greenblatt was an undergraduate at Wharton in the late 1970s, his professors insisted that there was no point even <i>trying</i> to beat the market. As proponents of the efficient-market theory, they claimed that stock prices incorporate all of the information that’s publicly available. As they saw it, the interaction between knowledgeable buyers and sellers results in stocks being priced efficiently at their fair value, which means that it’s futile to hunt for bargains.</p>
<p class="indent">Intellectually, it’s an elegant theory—a testament to the collective wisdom of crowds. What’s more, it’s had the positive effect of drawing many regular investors into index funds. They are built upon the disheartening but realistic notion that, if you can’t <i>beat</i> the market, you should focus on matching its returns at the lowest possible cost. For the vast majority of investors, indexing is the most rational—and simplest—strategy of all.</p>
<p class="indent"><span aria-label="page 121" id="page_121" role="doc-pagebreak"/>But Greenblatt didn’t buy what he was being taught. “I had a visceral response to what I was learning about efficient markets,” he says. “It didn’t seem to make sense to me just on a basic level of looking at the newspaper and seeing what was happening.”</p>
<p class="indent">For a start, he could see that stocks routinely experience wild swings between their fifty-two-week highs and lows. If a stock trades at $50 in February and shoots up to $90 in November, how could it be correctly priced at both extremes? And what about hot stocks, such as the Nifty Fifty, that suddenly burst into flames? For example, did the purportedly all-knowing crowd price Polaroid fairly at $150 in 1972 <i>and</i> at $14 in 1974? It seemed highly unlikely.</p>
<p class="indent">Greenblatt saw that the overall market also lurches erratically from one extreme to another. The euphoric boom and sickening bust of 1972–74 established a pattern of head-wrenching volatility that he would observe throughout his career. He points out that the S&amp;P 500 doubled from 1996 to 2000, halved from 2000 to 2002, doubled from 2002 to 2007, halved from 2007 to 2009, and tripled from 2009 to 2017. Were investors logically and efficiently setting stock prices as the market soared, stumbled, and swooned? Or were they much less rational than the academic theorists wanted to believe?</p>
<p class="indent">Greenblatt graduated summa cum laude in 1979 and enrolled in Wharton’s MBA program. But his formal education did little to resolve these market mysteries. He took a class on investment management, but failed to find enlightenment in abstruse topics such as quadratic parametric programming. He did achieve one distinction: “I was able to get the lowest grade in the class.”</p>
<p class="indent">Greenblatt was saved by <i>Forbes</i>. In his junior year at Wharton, he had chanced upon a short article about Ben Graham’s strategy for identifying bargain stocks. That led him to read <i>Security Analysis</i> and <i>The Intelligent Investor</i>, which he describes as “the antithesis of what I was learning at school.” Graham’s perspective on how the market works “was so simple and clear,” says Greenblatt, “that it got me very excited.”</p>
<p class="indent">Above all, Graham taught him one life-changing lesson. As Greenblatt puts it, “Stocks are ownership shares of businesses,” which “you’re valuing and trying to buy at a discount.” The key, then, is to identify situations in which there’s a particularly large spread between the <i>price</i> <span aria-label="page 122" id="page_122" role="doc-pagebreak"/>and the <i>value</i> of the business. That spread gives you a margin of safety, which Greenblatt (like Graham and Buffett) regards as the single most important concept in investing.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Once you realize that your entire mission is to value businesses and pay much less for them than they’re worth, it’s incredibly liberating.</b> “If you see it that simply and can keep that simplicity in your mind, it’s very compelling and almost makes a lot of what <i>else</i> you see look silly,” says Greenblatt. “It kind of gets rid of ninety-nine percent of everything else that anyone had ever told me about how to look at the world and the market.”</p>
<p class="indent">Many investors get rattled when they read the latest news about, say, a Greek debt crisis that threatens the European economy. But Greenblatt says, “The way I look at it is, if I own a chain store in the Midwest, am I all of a sudden going to sell it for half of what it’s worth because something bad happened in Greece? I don’t think so! But that’s what you read in the newspaper, and that’s what everyone is looking at. If you have a context to say, ‘Well, does it matter or doesn’t it matter?’—it’s just very helpful.”</p>
<p class="indent">Indeed, you start to realize that much of the investment world is engaged in fruitless nonsense. Wall Street economists and market strategists pontificate about macroeconomic headwinds and tailwinds that nobody can reliably or consistently predict. Media pundits muse about the significance of short-term price fluctuations that are random and meaningless. Highly intelligent analysts at brokerage firms squander their time calculating next quarter’s corporate earnings to the exact penny—an absurd guessing game that’s irrelevant to successful, long-term investors.</p>
<p class="indent">Not to be outdone, academics teach complicated mathematical formulas and speak in a private code about Sharpe ratios, Sortino ratios, alpha, beta, the Modigliani-Modigliani measure, and other arcane concepts that lend an air of scientific exactitude to the messiness of the markets. Meanwhile, investment consultants harness these highfalutin notions to convince clients that their portfolios need frequent, subtle fine-tuning. Buffett has derided these high-priced peddlers of complexity as “hyper-helpers” whose “advice is often delivered in esoteric gibberish.”</p>
<p class="indent"><span aria-label="page 123" id="page_123" role="doc-pagebreak"/>By contrast, Graham wrote simply and clearly about “Mr. Market.” He encapsulated the entire game of investing in one brief parable about this muddle-headed character. In <i>The Intelligent Investor</i>, Graham suggests imagining that you own a $1,000 stake in a private business. Every day, your partner—the obliging but irrational Mr. Market—provides you with a valuation of that stake. His price quote changes based on how enthusiastic or fearful he feels that day: “You may be happy to sell out to him when he quotes you a ridiculously high price and equally happy to buy from him when his price is low.” The rest of the time, you can sit on your hands, waiting for Mr. Market to lose his mind once more and offer you another deal that you can’t refuse.</p>
<p class="indent">In other words, the market isn’t an efficient machine that reliably and consistently sets fair prices. It’s a comedy of errors, a festival of folly. “People are crazy and emotional,” says Greenblatt. “They buy and sell things in an emotional way, not in a logical way, and that’s the only reason why we have any opportunity.… So if you have a way to value businesses that’s disciplined and makes sense, you should be able to take advantage of other people’s emotions.”</p>
<p class="indent">This raises an obvious but crucial question: <i>Do you know how to value a business?</i></p>
<p class="indent">There’s nothing admirable or shameful about your response. But you and I need to answer this question honestly, since self-delusion is a costly habit in extreme sports such as skydiving and stock picking. “It’s a very small fraction of people that can value businesses—and if you can’t do that, I don’t think you should be investing on your own,” says Greenblatt. “How can you invest intelligently if you can’t figure out what something is worth?”<sup class="sup"><a href="footnotes.xhtml#footnote-023" id="footnote-023-backlink">VII</a></sup> He adds that “most people should just index” because “they don’t understand what they’re doing.”</p>
<p class="indent">I don’t have the technical skills, patience, or interest to value businesses. So it makes sense for me to outsource the job to professionals who are better equipped for the task. This self-restraint should save me a lot of pain. As Greenblatt observes in <i>The Little Book That Beats the</i> <span aria-label="page 124" id="page_124" role="doc-pagebreak"/><i>Market</i>, “Choosing individual stocks without any idea of what you’re looking for is like running through a dynamite factory with a burning match. You may live, but you’re still an idiot.”</p>
<p class="indent">Every few years, I ignore this warning and buy an individual stock, despite my better judgment. I currently own three stocks. One is Berkshire Hathaway, which I expect to hold for many years. I’d like to think that I understand the business well enough to justify this long-term investment. Less defensibly, I also own a tiny stake in a mining-and-property company recommended to me by a well-known investor who shall remain nameless. How has it done? So far, it’s down 87 percent. For now, I’m keeping it as a painful reminder to be more careful around lit matches and dynamite. Stock number three is Seritage Growth Properties, a contrarian investment that I cloned from Mohnish Pabrai when the retail real estate sector crashed in 2020.</p>
<p class="indent">Depending on the business, Greenblatt uses some combination of four standard valuation techniques. Method 1: he performs a <i>discounted cash flow analysis</i>, calculating the net present value of the company’s estimated future earnings. Method 2: he assesses the company’s <i>relative value</i>, comparing it to the price of similar businesses. Method 3: he estimates the company’s <i>acquisition value</i>, figuring out what an informed buyer might pay for it. Method 4: he calculates the company’s <i>liquidation value</i>, analyzing what it would be worth if it closed and sold its assets.</p>
<p class="indent">None of these methods is precise, and each has its limitations. But Greenblatt works on the basis that, if a stock is sufficiently cheap, the upside potential significantly outweighs the downside. The underlying concept of buying bargains is simplicity itself. But the execution process <i>isn’t</i> that simple because it involves such complexities as (roughly) predicting a company’s future earnings and cash flows. This reminds me of an acerbic comment about investing that Charlie Munger once made at the end of a lunch with Howard Marks: “It’s not supposed to be easy. Anyone who thinks it’s easy is stupid.”</p>
<p class="indent">Greenblatt insists that his own valuation skills are merely “average.” Rather, his advantage stems chiefly from his ability to “contextualize” everything he sees in the market, fitting it all into a coherent framework. His faith in this framework is so strong that he issues a guarantee <span aria-label="page 125" id="page_125" role="doc-pagebreak"/>to his Columbia students: if they do a decent job of valuing businesses, buy them at a steep discount to their intrinsic value, and wait patiently for the gap to close between the current price and their appraisal of the value, the market will eventually reward them.<sup class="sup"><a href="footnotes.xhtml#footnote-022" id="footnote-022-backlink">VIII</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">The hitch is that you can never tell how long the process of convergence between price and value will take. Still, he says, “I’m a firm believer that, in 90 percent of the cases, the market will recognize that value within two or three years.”</p>
<p class="indent">This points to a fundamental truth that is one of the most dependable laws of the financial universe. In the short term, the market is irrational and frequently misprices stocks—but in the long term, it’s surprisingly rational. “Eventually,” says Greenblatt, “Mr. Market gets it right.”</p>
<h2 class="h2x">Unfair Bets and Ugly Ducklings</h2>
<p class="noindent">After leaving Wharton, Greenblatt headed to Stanford Law School, mostly to avoid getting an actual job. He dropped out after a year. Many of his peers followed well-trodden paths to become corporate lawyers or investment bankers. But he didn’t fancy toiling for a hundred hours a week at a vast, faceless corporation in the pursuit of a conventional career. Ultimately, he wanted to find an enjoyable way to “get paid for smart ideas, rather than punching a clock.”</p>
<p class="indent">In the meantime, he took a summer job at Bear Stearns, where he fell into a relatively new field: options trading. He recalls, “I was executing riskless arbitrage trades by literally running across the trading floor, getting a printout from the one printer, running back to my desk,” and scouring the printout to “look for anomalies that I could trade.” By using put and call options, he could lock in “automatic profits” with no risk of loss. “It opened me up to what was possible on Wall Street.”</p>
<p class="indent"><span aria-label="page 126" id="page_126" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Greenblatt had always been fascinated by gambling. At fifteen, he’d discovered the furtive joy of sneaking into a dog track and wagering a couple of bucks on a greyhound. His brain was built for betting. “I like calculating the odds,” he says. “Consciously or unconsciously, I’m calculating the odds on every investment. What’s the upside? What’s the downside?” When I mention that all of the best investors seem to think probabilistically, carefully weighing the odds of different outcomes, he replies, “I don’t think you can be a good investor <i>without</i> thinking in that way.”</p>
<p class="indent">Greenblatt spent the next three years as an analyst at a start-up investment firm, making “risk arbitrage” bets on companies involved in mergers. It didn’t take him long to realize that this was a game with odious odds. If a merger went ahead as planned, “you could make a dollar or two,” he says. But if the deal unexpectedly fell apart, “you could lose ten or twenty.” This was “the exact opposite” of Graham’s strategy of buying dirt cheap stocks, “where you can lose a dollar or two and <i>make</i> ten or twenty. <i>That’s</i> a good risk/reward.”</p>
<p class="indent">In 1985, Greenblatt launched Gotham Capital with the intention of applying the principles he had learned from Graham. Greenblatt started with $7 million in capital, most of it supplied by Michael Milken, the king of junk bonds, whom he’d met through a classmate from Wharton. Milken reputedly earned more than $1 billion in four years at Drexel Burnham Lambert, so a little side bet on a promising but unproven twenty-seven-year-old wasn’t much of a risk.<sup class="sup"><a href="footnotes.xhtml#footnote-021" id="footnote-021-backlink">IX</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Greenblatt says his investment strategy at Gotham involved “making money not from taking risk but from making unfair bets.” That’s to say, he invested only when the odds seemed to favor him overwhelmingly. The details changed from one investment to the next, but he always sought “asymmetric” propositions where “I can’t lose much and maybe I’ll make a lot.” He quips, “If you don’t lose money, most of the other alternatives are good.”</p>
<p class="indent"><span aria-label="page 127" id="page_127" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Unfair bets are rare, but Greenblatt didn’t need that many. He typically had 80 percent of his fund riding on six to eight investments—an extraordinary level of concentration. “There aren’t that many great opportunities,” he explains. “I was looking for low hurdles—things that other people would have bought, too, if they’d done the work.”</p>
<p class="indent">Building on his experience in risk arbitrage, he developed an expertise in “special situations” that most investors overlooked, including corporate spin-offs, restructurings, and “orphan equities” that were emerging from bankruptcy. He also invested in small stocks with liquidity constraints, since most institutional investors were too big to buy them. He remarks, “It’s easier to find bargains off the beaten path or in extraordinary situations that other people aren’t looking at.”</p>
<p class="indent">Greenblatt had the latitude to prospect in these “offbeat places” because he never let his fund become bloated. “We could have raised whatever amount we wanted, but you lower your returns,” he says. In 1994, when Gotham’s assets reached about $300 million, he returned all of the outside capital. As a result, the fund remained nimble enough to venture anywhere.</p>
<p class="indent">Indeed, when I ask him to explain Gotham’s success, the first factor he cites is that “we remained small.” The second is that his portfolio was exceptionally concentrated, so “you only have to find a few ideas.” The third? “We got a little lucky.” Over the years, he explains, Gotham suffered remarkably few disasters, which he attributes partly to good fortune. “I also hated losing money,” he adds. “So we really put the bar very high before we would buy anything.”</p>
<p class="indent">Greenblatt’s ultraselective strategy meant that he routinely rejected stocks that looked good, not great. Likewise, if it was too difficult to value a particular business, he walked away. “I want to keep it easy for myself,” he says. “Maybe I’m a little lazier than most people. Or, at least, I’m trying to pursue things that are one-foot hurdles rather than ten-foot hurdles.”</p>
<p class="indent">But on those rare occasions when the market delivered a fat pitch right in his sweet spot, he didn’t hesitate to whack it with all his might. One of these precious gifts from the financial gods arrived in 1993—a dream investment, says Greenblatt, that “had pretty much everything in it.”</p>
<p class="indent"><span aria-label="page 128" id="page_128" role="doc-pagebreak"/>It all began with the announcement in October 1992 that the Marriott Corporation would split in two. The company had landed itself in trouble during a real estate downturn, says Greenblatt, and “got caught with a pile of hotels that they had built and now couldn’t sell.” Stephen Bollenbach, a financial wizard who had just restructured Donald Trump’s collapsing casino and hotel empire, parachuted into Marriott to perform another corporate rescue mission.</p>
<p class="indent">Marriott had two businesses: a beautiful swan and an ugly duckling. The beautiful business generated a rich and predictable fee stream by managing hotels for other companies. The ugly business, which built and owned hotels, was overloaded with debt. Bollenbach prescribed a drastic surgical procedure to separate the two businesses.</p>
<p class="indent">The beautiful part would be carved off into a new company, Marriott International. About 85 percent of the Marriott Corporation’s value would be neatly repackaged in this pristine, debt-free spin-off. Meanwhile, the unsellable hotels and about $2.5 billion in debt would be dumped into a second company, Host Marriott—a nasty little castoff that would apparently consist of all the toxic waste that no one wanted to own. The beautiful swan (Marriott International) would be free to swim off into the sunset, leaving the ugly duckling (Host Marriott) to drown. Or so it seemed.</p>
<p class="indent">Greenblatt knew that almost nobody would bother to analyze Host Marriott, let alone invest in it. “It just looked horrible,” he says. “It had a lot of debt. It was in a bad business. There was nothing good about it.” Moreover, it was too tiny for most institutional investors to hold, even if they could tolerate the stench. Existing shareholders of the Marriott Corporation would receive stock in Host Marriott when the spin-off was completed. But Greenblatt was sure they would sell in droves. So what did he do? He zeroed in on the ugly duckling.</p>
<p class="indent">“The way you’re going to find bargains,” he says, is by searching for hidden value in assets “that other people don’t want.”</p>
<p class="indent">One clue that Host Marriott might not be as rotten as it looked was that Bollenbach (“the guy who designed this evil plan”) was going to run it. Why would this canny moneymaker want to take charge of the business if it was truly destined for bankruptcy? It turned out that he was well incentivized to turn the firm around. For good measure, the <span aria-label="page 129" id="page_129" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Marriott family would also own 25 percent of Host Marriott. So some savvy insiders had a powerful interest in its success.</p>
<p class="indent">Greenblatt studied the company in depth and discovered a surprising amount of value. Sure, there was plenty of “lousy real estate,” including some unfinished hotels. But there were also some valuable assets, such as airport restaurant concessions and several debt-free properties.</p>
<p class="indent">Best of all, the stock was fabulously cheap at around $4 per share. His best guess was that the debt-free assets <i>alone</i> were worth $6 per share. But there was also a debt-laden subsidiary that might be valuable, too, if its fortunes ever improved. “The asymmetry was so amazing,” he says. “I was buying six dollars’ worth of assets with no debt on it for four dollars, plus I had the upside on the other pile of assets. If the subsidiary was worth nothing, then I just paid four dollars for something worth six dollars.”</p>
<p class="indent">So Greenblatt loaded up, staking almost <i>40 percent</i> of his fund’s assets on Host Marriott. It was a breathtakingly bold move. Here was a struggling business that was leveraged to the hilt. Yet Greenblatt saw what everyone else missed: an irresistibly unfair bet.</p>
<p class="indent">As Graham had taught him, what mattered most was the margin of safety. If you bought a stock for much less than its intrinsic value, other investors would figure it out sooner or later and drive up the price. In the meantime, says Greenblatt, “I didn’t see how I was going to lose much money.” That’s precisely why he made such an aggressive bet. “You size your positions based on how much risk you’re taking,” he says. <b>“I don’t buy more of the ones I can make the most money on. I buy more of the ones that I can’t</b> <span class="bolditalic">lose</span> <b>money on.”</b></p>
<p class="indent">So what happened? In the fall of 1993, Host Marriott began trading as an independent company. Within four months, Greenblatt tripled his money as this ugly duckling defied its doubters and took flight. Greenblatt had never expected the wager to work out so quickly. “That was luck,” he says. “But we set ourselves up to get lucky.”</p>
<p class="indent">Now, before I get too carried away, I’ll admit that the <i>execution</i> of this investment was not that simple. For a start, Greenblatt bought preferred shares, which would have given him an extra measure of protection if the company had gone bust. He also used call options to structure his bet. What’s more, it required a rare combination of cold <span aria-label="page 130" id="page_130" role="doc-pagebreak"/>rationality, independence of mind, and sheer guts to stake so much on a widely reviled business. Still, the underlying principle could not have been simpler. Remember? <i>“Figure out what something is worth and pay a lot less.”</i></p>
<h2 class="h2x">Cheap + Good = The Holy Grail</h2>
<p class="noindent">Greenblatt’s investment approach continued to evolve, partly because he saw how Buffett had updated and improved Graham’s strategy of buying undervalued stocks. As Greenblatt explains, Buffett added “one little, simple twist,” which “made him one of the richest people in the world: <b>Buying cheap is great—and if I can buy</b> <span class="bolditalic">good</span> <b>businesses cheap, even better.”</b></p>
<p class="indent">In his early days, Buffett had made a fortune trading in and out of mediocre companies that he bought at a deep discount. But as his assets ballooned, he needed a more scalable strategy. Under Munger’s influence, Buffett shifted to buying what he described as “wonderful businesses at fair prices” and holding them indefinitely. In 1988, Berkshire invested $650 million in Coca-Cola, paying what seemed to be an exorbitant price.<sup class="sup"><a href="footnotes.xhtml#footnote-020" id="footnote-020-backlink">X</a></sup> On the contrary, it proved to be a steal. Why? Because it was an exceptional growth machine with a sustainable competitive advantage and high returns on invested capital. Berkshire ended up making ten times its money in twelve years.</p>
<p class="indent">By studying Buffett, Greenblatt gained a clearer sense of what constitutes a wonderful business. A prime specimen presented itself in 2000 with the spin-off of Moody’s Corporation, a credit-rating agency that had been part of Dun &amp; Bradstreet. Moody’s “didn’t appear on its face to be cheaply priced,” says Greenblatt. But in a perfect example of cloning, he and Goldstein reverse engineered Buffett’s Coca-Cola purchase to figure out whether Moody’s might also be worth a premium price. They concluded that it was possibly the best business they’d ever seen.</p>
<p class="indent">Moody’s was one of two dominant players in a lucrative niche with <span aria-label="page 131" id="page_131" role="doc-pagebreak"/>high barriers to entry. Its revenues had grown by 15 percent a year for almost two decades. And while Coke boasted impressive returns on capital, Moody’s could keep growing at a healthy clip with <i>no</i> capital investment, other than paying for a few desks and computers. Greenblatt assumed conservatively that its earnings could continue to grow by 12 percent a year for a decade. The trouble was, the stock traded at a rich multiple of twenty-one times next year’s earnings. But when he considered what Buffett had paid for Coke, he realized that Moody’s was “still pretty darn cheap.”</p>
<p class="indent">Who else recognized this bargain in disguise? Buffett. He bought 15 percent of Moody’s and still owns much of his stake two decades later. By 2020, shares that he originally bought for $248 million were worth almost $6 billion. By contrast, Greenblatt took a handsome profit and redeployed his money in cheaper stocks. “Pretty much everything we ever owned, we sold way too early,” he says. “If you’re very cheap in buying, it’s hard to be as comfortable when something has doubled or tripled, even if it’s still good.”</p>
<p class="indent">As a professor and a writer, Greenblatt kept pushing himself to articulate more clearly what he’d figured out about how to invest. This process “was incredibly helpful to me in trying to boil down in a very simple way exactly what I had been trying to do,” he says. “It boiled down simpler and simpler.” And what he came to realize is that it all boiled down to this: <b>Buy good businesses at bargain prices.</b> This combines the purified essence of Graham and Buffett.</p>
<p class="indent">Greenblatt’s career provided plenty of anecdotal evidence that this is a smart way to win the investment game. But he wanted to prove more rigorously that he had broken the code. So, in 2003, he launched a research project that would ultimately cost about $35 million. His mission: to demonstrate that “cheap and good” companies generate outsize returns.</p>
<p class="indent">He hired a “computer jockey” to crunch vast quantities of data, so he could explore how these businesses had performed historically. Greenblatt needed a shorthand measure of cheapness and quality. So he chose two metrics as a rough gauge of these essential traits. First, the company should have a high earnings yield—an indication that it generates lots of earnings relative to its price. Second, it should have a high <span aria-label="page 132" id="page_132" role="doc-pagebreak"/>return on tangible capital—an indication that it’s a quality business that effectively converts fixed assets and working capital into earnings.<sup class="sup"><a href="footnotes.xhtml#footnote-019" id="footnote-019-backlink">XI</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">The computer whiz then analyzed 3,500 US stocks, ranking them based on these two metrics. Those with the highest combined score should, in general, be above-average businesses trading at below-average prices. Greenblatt wanted to know what would happen if a hypothetical investor bought thirty of these stocks at the start of a year, sold them after a year, then replaced them with a fresh batch of thirty top-ranked stocks. In his study, he assumed that this process would be repeated every year, creating a systematic way of investing in cheap and good companies.<sup class="sup"><a href="footnotes.xhtml#footnote-018" id="footnote-018-backlink">XII</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Greenblatt was “quite amazed” by the results of the back tests. From 1988 to 2004, this strategy would have generated an average return of 30.8 percent a year, versus 12.4 percent a year for the S&amp;P 500. At that rate, $100,000 would have grown to more than $9.6 million, versus about $730,000 for the S&amp;P 500. Here was a stock-picking strategy that relied solely on two metrics—and it annihilated the market. It was a startling testament to the power of simplicity.</p>
<p class="indent">Greenblatt drew on this research to write his miniature gem, <i>The Little Book That Beats the Market</i>. In between the jokes, he laid out how to “beat the pants off even the best investment professionals” by using “just two simple tools.” If you want to become “a stock market master,” he explained, <i>“stick to buying good companies (ones that have a high return on capital) and to buying those companies only at bargain prices (at prices that give you a high earnings yield).”</i></p>
<p class="indent"><span aria-label="page 133" id="page_133" role="doc-pagebreak"/>He dubbed this simple combination of two winning traits “the magic formula.”</p>
<h2 class="h2x">Do You Believe in Magic?</h2>
<p class="noindent">There is just one problem. Most investors fail miserably to become stock market masters—even when you’ve done all of the hard thinking for them and presented them with a magic formula.</p>
<p class="indent">After <i>The Little Book</i> was published in 2005, Greenblatt began to realize how difficult it was to execute the plan he’d recommended to his readers. He and his kids tried doing it, but found it tricky to keep track of so many trades. He adds, “I got literally hundreds of emails from people saying, ‘Hey, thanks for the book. Can you just do this <i>for</i> me?’ ” He also worried that some readers might harm themselves by using unreliable corporate data pulled from the internet or by messing up the calculations when they tried to apply his formula. What if these errors led them to choose the wrong stocks and he actually hurt the people he’d set out to help?</p>
<p class="indent">Greenblatt’s solution was to create a free website, <a href="http://www.magicformulainvesting.com">www.magicformulainvesting.com</a>, which used reliable data and made it easy to screen for stocks that met his two criteria. He often jokes, “There ain’t no tooth fairy on Wall Street.” But he liked the idea of protecting regular investors. So he also set up what he calls a “benevolent brokerage firm,” which allowed customers to invest solely in his preapproved list of magic formula stocks.</p>
<p class="indent">Greenblatt gave his brokerage clients two choices. Option 1: they could open a “professionally managed” account, which followed a predetermined process of systematically buying and selling stocks from his approved list at fixed intervals. About 90 percent of the clients chose this do-it-for-me option, which freed them from making any decisions. Option 2: they could take a DIY approach, picking a recommended minimum of twenty stocks from the same list and deciding for themselves when to buy or sell. The plucky few who opted for this DIY route presumably expected that their own judgment would add a little extra magic. Ahh, such hubris!</p>
<p class="indent"><span aria-label="page 134" id="page_134" role="doc-pagebreak"/>When Greenblatt studied thousands of clients’ accounts, he was shocked to discover how much worse the DIY investors performed. Over a two-year period, this group generated a cumulative return of 59.4 percent, versus 62.7 percent for the S&amp;P 500. By contrast, the group with professionally managed accounts enjoyed a return of 84.1 percent, trouncing the S&amp;P 500 index by 21.4 percentage points. Amazingly, the DIY investors had squandered almost 25 percentage points of performance by <i>making their own decisions</i>. Their “judgment” had transformed a market-beating strategy into a market-trailing dud. It was a startling display of self-sabotage.</p>
<p class="indent">“They made all the faux pas that investors do,” says Greenblatt. “When the market went up, they piled in. When it went down, they piled out. When the strategy was outperforming, they piled in. When the strategy was underperforming, they stopped doing it.” In theory, they may have believed in his concept of buying high-quality businesses at low prices. In practice, they chased after stocks when they were more expensive and abandoned them when they were cheaper.</p>
<p class="indent">To make matters worse, the DIY investors also shunned the ugliest stocks on the magic formula list, failing to recognize that these were often the most alluring bargains. Emotionally, it was hard to buy the cheapest companies on the list because their near-term prospects looked bleak and they were frequently tainted by bad news. Fearful of this uncertainty, investors missed out when these beaten-down stocks rebounded and became some of the biggest winners.</p>
<p class="indent">All of this self-defeating behavior highlights one of the thorniest challenges confronting every investor. <b>It’s not enough to find a smart strategy that stacks the odds in your favor over the long haul. You also need the discipline and tenacity to apply that strategy consistently, especially when it’s most uncomfortable.</b></p>
<p class="indent">It helps immeasurably, says Greenblatt, “if you have simple principles that you can just stick to… simple principles that make sense, that are unshakable.” Why is this so critical? Because you need this clarity of thought to withstand all of the psychological pressures, setbacks, and temptations that can destabilize or derail you along the way. “It’s a hard business and the market is not always agreeing with you,” says Greenblatt. “It’s the nature of the beast that stock prices are emotional, <span aria-label="page 135" id="page_135" role="doc-pagebreak"/>and you’re going to be hit from every which way, and you’re going to be reading every expert saying you’re wrong.”</p>
<p class="indent">It’s particularly hard to keep the faith when you’re losing money or have lagged the market for several years. You start to wonder if your strategy still works or if something has fundamentally changed. But the truth is, <i>no</i> strategy works all of the time. So these periods of financial and psychic suffering are an unavoidable part of the game. Inevitably, weaker players fall by the wayside, creating more opportunity for those with the sturdiest principles and the strongest temperaments. As Greenblatt puts it, “One of the beauties of the pain that people have to take in underperformance is that, if it did not exist, everyone would do what we do.”</p>
<p class="indent">Greenblatt has the conviction to hold firm during those painful periods. But it’s easy to see why the average investor might waiver. In a back test involving the one thousand largest companies in the United States, the magic formula generated an average annual return of 19.7 percent from 1988 to 2009, versus 9.5 percent annually for the S&amp;P 500. That’s a phenomenal margin of victory. Still, the formula trailed the index in six of those twenty-two years, and it produced brutal losses of 25.3 percent in 2002 and 38.8 percent in 2008. When you’re bleeding that badly, it’s hard to remain unflappable unless you share Greenblatt’s deep-seated certainty in the inexorable logic of the strategy.</p>
<p class="indent">These experiences have led him to an important revelation: “For most individuals, the best strategy is not the one that’s going to get you the highest return.” Rather, the ideal is “a <i>good</i> strategy that you can stick with” even “in bad times.”</p>
<p class="indent">In recent years, that realization has inspired Greenblatt to develop a new mousetrap—a long/short strategy that’s designed to reduce risk and provide a “less painful” ride. His goal: to compound money at a reasonable rate with less violent volatility, so that investors in his funds are more likely to “make it to the long term.”</p>
<p class="indent">It’s a surprising evolution for a famed gunslinger whose concentrated approach returned 40 percent a year for two decades. But it’s a reminder that most investors should shoot for solid and sustainable returns, instead of something more heroic. “When I owned six or eight names, it was not uncommon to lose twenty or thirty percent in a few <span aria-label="page 136" id="page_136" role="doc-pagebreak"/>days every two or three years,” says Greenblatt. “It’s a difficult strategy to stick with, so it’s not good for most individual investors. But that’s perfectly good for me. When something falls twenty or thirty percent, I don’t panic because I know what I own.”</p>
<p class="indent">Nowadays, Greenblatt’s team values more than four thousand businesses and ranks them based on how cheap they are. On the long side, his funds buy hundreds of stocks that trade at a discount to his estimates of fair value. He automatically bets more on the cheapest stock than on the second cheapest. On the short side, he bets <i>against</i> hundreds of stocks that trade at a premium. Again, his position size is determined by valuation, so the most expensive stock is automatically his biggest short position. “Our underlying theme is, buy the cheapest, short the most expensive—and I do that in a very systematic way,” he says. “There’s no emotion involved.” He knows that some bets will go against him, but he’s looking merely “to be right on average.”</p>
<p class="indent">It’s no easy task to execute a complex strategy involving hundreds of long and short positions. Greenblatt built a twenty-person team of financial analysts and tech mavens to help him pull it off. Yet the principles underpinning his strategy are, as ever, so simple and robust that all of us would do well to remember them:</p>
<ol class="nlist">
<li class="order"><b>1. Stocks are ownership shares of businesses, which must be valued.</b></li>
<li class="order"><b>2. They should be bought only when they trade for less than they are worth.</b></li>
<li class="order"><b>3. In the long run, the market is rational and will (more or less) reflect the fair value of these businesses.</b></li>
</ol>
<p class="indent">The problem is that nobody ever knows if this journey toward fair value will take weeks, months, or many years. But Greenblatt is willing to wait because he trusts that these time-tested principles will eventually hold true. “If stocks are ownership shares of businesses and I’m pretty good at valuing them—at least, on average—I’ll do well over time,” he says. “The laws of economics and gravity will not be repealed.”</p>
<h2 class="h2x"><span aria-label="page 137" id="page_137" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Four Simple Lessons</h2>
<p class="noindent">When I think about everything that I’ve learned from Greenblatt, I’m struck above all by four simple lessons. <b>First, you don’t need the optimal strategy. You need a</b> <span class="bolditalic">sensible</span> <b>strategy that’s</b> <span class="bolditalic">good enough</span> <b>to achieve your financial goals.</b> As the Prussian military strategist General Carl von Clausewitz said, “The greatest enemy of a good plan is the dream of a perfect plan.”</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Second, your strategy should be so simple and logical that you understand it, believe in it to your core, and can stick with it even in the difficult times when it no longer seems to work.</b> The strategy must also suit your tolerance for pain, volatility, and loss. It helps to write down the strategy, the principles upon which it stands, and why you expect it to work over time. Think of this as a policy statement or a financial code of conduct. In times of stress and confusion, you can review this document to restore your equilibrium and regain your sense of direction.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Third, you need to ask yourself whether you truly have the skills and temperament to beat the market.</b> Greenblatt possesses an unusual combination of characteristics that give him a significant edge. He has the analytical brilliance to deconstruct a complex game, breaking it down into the most fundamental principles: <i>value a business, buy it at a discount, then wait</i>. He knows how to value businesses. He isn’t influenced by conventional opinion or authority figures such as the Wharton professors who claimed that the market is efficient. On the contrary, he delights in proving them wrong again and again. He’s also patient, even-tempered, self-assured, competitive, rational, and disciplined.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Fourth, it’s important to remember that you can be a rich and successful investor without attempting to beat the market.</b> Over several decades, Jack Bogle watched thousands of active fund managers try and fail to prove their long-term superiority over index funds. “All these stars proved to be comets,” he told me. “They light up the firmament for a moment in time. They burn out, and their ashes float gently down to earth. Believe me, it happens almost all the time.”</p>
<p class="indent">Bogle often argued that “the ultimate in simplicity” is to buy and <span aria-label="page 138" id="page_138" role="doc-pagebreak"/>hold a single balanced index fund that owns a fixed percentage of US and foreign stocks and bonds. And <i>that’s</i> it. No self-destructive attempts to time the market. No fantasies of picking the next hot stock or fund.</p>
<p class="indent">While writing this chapter, I followed his advice and chose a single index fund for my wife’s retirement account—a global fund that invests 80 percent of its assets in stocks and 20 percent in bonds. I’m sure this is not the optimal strategy. But it should be good enough, assuming that she holds on to the fund for many years and adds to it regularly. This is a simple strategy based on broad diversification, a reasonable balance between risk and reward, tax efficiency, exceptionally low expenses, and a long time horizon. It lacks boldness and panache. But as Bogle told me, “You don’t <i>have</i> to be great.”</p>
<p class="indent">Personally, I am perennially torn between the mathematical logic of indexing and the dream of beating the market. But I know this much: whichever path we choose, it pays to keep it simple.</p>
