        <p class="first1"><i class="calibre2">“My career can be broken into two chapters: the first was 15 years of banging my head against the wall trying to figure out why I was not fulfilling my potential. The second chapter started when I read ‘$100M Offers’ by Alex hormozi. It was then that I had the confidence to know exactly how to have the success that I knew I was capable of enjoying. If you are a business owner that is done settling for less than your potential, this book will quickly show you that it’s not your fault; no one has taught you how to make irresistible offers. <b class="calibre1">This book will change that within a few chapters</b>. Consider this book your second chapter<b class="calibre1">. It is an absolute game changer</b>.”</i></p>

Probably the biggest thing I learned from him is that so many times in business you want to charge your customers more and you almost feel guilty like ‘oh my gosh can I really do this?’ but I think there's nobody better that really puts packages and prices together that not only you can increase your price for your business but you're also increasing the value for the customer at the exact same time. <b class="calibre1">Since we started working</b> <b class="calibre1">with him...within two months...our business was already doing $10M/yr in sales...INSTANT DOUBLE and it’s only been two months since we came in touch with him and our business is on a run rate to do $23M/yr in sales now</b>.
