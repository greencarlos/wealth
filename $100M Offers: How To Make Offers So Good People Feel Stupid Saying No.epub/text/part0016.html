      <p class="first2 pcalibre1"><span class="first-letter3">P</span>eople who help others (with zero expectation) experience higher levels of fulfillment, live longer, <i class="calibre2">and</i> make more money. I’d like to create the opportunity to deliver this value to you during your reading or listening experience. In order to do so, I have a simple question for you...</p>
      <p class="subsq"><i class="calibre2"><span class="underline">Would you help someone you’ve never met, if it didn’t cost you money, but you never got credit for it?</span></i></p>
      <p class="subsq">If so, I have an ‘ask’ to make on behalf of someone you do not know. And likely, never will.</p>
      <p class="subsq">They are just like you, or like you were a few years ago: less experienced, full of desire to help the world, seeking information but unsure where to look….this is where you come in.</p>
      <p class="subsq">The only way for us at acquisition.com to accomplish our mission of helping entrepreneurs is, first, by reaching them. And most people do, in fact, judge a book by its cover (and it’s reviews). If you have found this book valuable thus far, would you please take a brief moment right now and leave an honest review of the book and its contents? It will cost you zero dollars and less than 60 seconds.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Your review will help….</p>
      <div class="prose1">
        <div class="title-page-contributor-primary-block">
        <p class="alignment-block-content3">….one more entrepreneur support his or her family.</p>

        <p class="alignment-block-content3">….one  more client experience a  transformation  they otherwise  would never have</p>

      <ul class="calibre8">
        <li class="calibre7"><span class="underline">If you are on audible</span> - hit the three dots in the top right of your device, click rate &amp; review, then leave a few sentences about the book with a star rating.</li>
        <li class="calibre7"><span class="underline">If you are reading on kindle or an e-reader</span> - you can scroll to the bottom of the book, then swipe up and it will automatically prompt a review.</li>
        <li class="calibre7"><span class="underline">If for some reason they have changed either functionality</span> - you can go to the book page on amazon (or wherever you purchased this) and leave a review right on the page.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subsq"><i class="calibre2">PS - </i>If you feel good about helping a faceless entrepreneur, you are my kind of people. I’m that much more excited to help you crush it in the coming chapters (you’ll love the tactics I’m about to go over).</p>
      <p class="subsq"><i class="calibre2">PPS -</i> Life hack: if you introduce something valuable to someone, they associate that value with you. If you’d like goodwill directly from another entrepreneur - send this book their way.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Thank you from the bottom of my heart. Now back to our regularly scheduled programming.</p>
      <p class="subsq">- Your biggest fan, Alex</p>
