      <p class="first2">My heart was racing. I could literally feel each beat pounding in my chest. I clenched my jaw to fend off the knot in my throat that I knew would lead to tears. I wanted to give in. Years of emotions were bottled below the surface.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Years of ignoring my reality and lack of success. Years of putting off how I felt just focusing on <i class="calibre2">moving forward</i>. The pressure was shooting to the surface. I could <i class="calibre2">feel</i> it.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“We did it,” I said.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Leila, my wife now, looked up at me. She was in the kitchen making dinner and stopped, spatula in hand. “What do you mean?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“We did it. We hit $100k.” I could barely get the words out because I didn’t want the tears to break through the tremble in my voice.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Like revenue?”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“No. Like in our personal bank accounts.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Holy shit really?! That’s amazing!!”</p>
      <p class="subsq">She ran over to me, disregarding the food on the stove, and wrapped her arms around my neck, spatula still in hand.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“I’m so proud of you”</p>
      <p class="subsq">She squeezed me. I slumped into her arms. It was like every knot in my body that I had been holding onto melted all at once. I could barely contain myself. But when I think back to it, the feeling I had wasn’t happiness. It was relief. I’d moved from fear to security. I’d traded feeling like a failure everyday, watching my work and effort yield nothing, to realizing a dream. The constant anxiety and fear of “what are we gonna do” <i class="calibre2">finally</i> be replaced by something else. I finally had time to let myself feel something.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I felt like this “struggle” chapter of life was finally over.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Look,” I said. “It’s for real”</p>
      <p class="subsq">I nuzzled my head out of Leila’s arms. I didn't want to look her in the eyes because I knew it would put me over the edge. I pulled my phone out and put it between us. We both stared at the unmoving screen with our personal bank account balance.</p>
      <p class="subsq"><i class="calibre2">$101,018</i></p>
      <p class="subsq">Our gazes remained unbroken as they confirmed a new, shared reality. It wasn’t an illusion. It wasn’t revenue. It wasn’t “profit” that was still in the business account, only to be taken out later by some unforeseen emergency. It wasn’t “earmarked” money that had to be used to pay off some debt. It was <i class="calibre2">ours</i>. For real.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“Babe,” I said. “We could fuck up and not make another dollar for three straight years, and still be okay.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">At the time, $33,000 per year was more than enough for us to live at our current expenses for three years <i class="calibre2">and some</i>.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Years of ups and downs. Years of ploughing money into my business(es) only to watch it vanish in overhead, payroll, and mistakes. Years of seminars, courses, workshops, coaching programs, masterminds . . . had F-I-N-A-L-L-Y turned into wealth. It felt like I had broken into a new plane. The relative increase in wealth was more than I ever felt.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Tens of millions of dollars in the bank later, it was, and still is, the richest I have ever felt in my life. It was the beginning of the next chapter in my life as a business person and entrepreneur.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Some people get there fast. Some people get there slowly. But everyone gets there eventually, as long as you don’t give up. Keep moving forward. Keep getting up. Keep believing it can happen.</p>
      <p class="subsq">And, it will.</p>
      <p class="subsq"><b class="calibre1">In A Nutshell</b></p>
      <p class="subsq">We’ve covered a lot. And I think it’s important for information to sink in, that it be consolidated and restated. So this is the “back of the napkin” bullet list to summarize what we’ve learned so far and why.</p>
      <ol class="calibre6">
        <li value="1" class="calibre7">We covered why you must not be a commodity in this marketplace.</li>
        <li value="2" class="calibre7">Why you should pick a normal or growing market, and why niches get you riches.</li>
        <li value="3" class="calibre7">Why you should charge a lot of money.</li>
        <li value="4" class="calibre7">How to charge a lot of money using the four core value drivers.</li>
        <li value="5" class="calibre7">How to create your value offer in five steps.</li>
        <li value="6" class="calibre7">How to stack the value, deliver it, and make it profitable.</li>
        <li value="7" class="calibre7">How to shift the demand curve in your favor using scarcity,</li>
        <li value="8" class="calibre7">How to use urgency to decrease the action threshold of buyers</li>
        <li value="9" class="calibre7">How to strategically use bonuses to increase the demand of your offer</li>
        <li value="10" class="calibre7">How to completely reverse buyer risk with a creative guarantee.</li>
        <li value="11" class="calibre7">How to name it in a way that resonates with your avatar.</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="subsq">You now have a valuable, high margin, de-commoditized grand slam offer. This is the first building block of a wonderful business — a product or service that people desperately want and truly solves their problem. For many, this will be enough to make far more sales, at higher prices, with more profit. Your first true grand slam offer should be able to get you to your first $100,000. For others, you will still want <i class="calibre2">more</i>. Which is 100 percent your right as a capitalist.</p>
      <p class="subsq">There’s so much more to building an acquisition machine <i class="calibre2">profitably</i>. I could not cover it all in one book. Out of respect for you, I wanted to make this thorough but manageable. That being said, the next book is dedicated to exactly that — <i class="calibre2">getting more</i> — through generating leads. In that book, I will break down <i class="calibre2">exactly</i> how to acquire customers <i class="calibre2">at a profit</i>. Meaning, if you structure your promotions correctly, you should never have to pay for a new customer again. That is the subject of <b class="calibre1"><span class="underline">Acquisition.com Volume II $100M: Lead</span></b> <b class="calibre1"><span class="underline">Generation</span></b>.</p>
      <p class="subsq"><b class="calibre1">Final Thoughts</b></p>
      <p class="subsq">Entrepreneurship is about acquiring skills, beliefs, and character traits. To advance, I find that we must determine which skills, beliefs, and character traits we <i class="calibre2">lack</i>. Most times, we simply need to improve. And the only way to do that is through learning from experience and/or high quality sources. I have received terrible advice from people who were ahead of me at the time. And though experience is the <i class="calibre2">best</i> teacher, she is not the kindest.</p>
      <p class="subsq">It is my most sincere hope that what I produce provides the guidance I so desperately needed when I was coming up on my entrepreneurial journey. And I wish I could cover it all in a single book (for my sake and yours). But, to do you the service I wish I had had, I cannot. The devil is in the details. Excellence exists in the depth of knowledge and nuances. That’s what separates the greats from everyone else. I hope that in all the content I produce you see my dedication to this detail and nuance that makes <i class="calibre2">all the difference</i>. These lessons were hard won.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I hope you’ve enjoyed this first volume in my offers series. Before we move forward into volume two, where we’ll be focusing on lead generation, as mentioned above, I wanted to circle back to where we started. After reading this book, I hope:</p>
      <ol class="calibre6">
        <li value="1" class="calibre7">You’re well on the path to creating your first Grand Slam Offer. Or at the very least, can take components that you were missing in your offer to make it more compelling to your market.</li>
        <li value="2" class="calibre7">I’ve delivered on my promise from the beginning of this book: that investing two to three hours of your time here would yield you a far higher return than just about anything else you could do.</li>
        <li value="3" class="calibre7">I hope in return I’ve taken one small step towards earning the thing I value most from you -- <b class="calibre1">your trust</b>.</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="subsq">Finally, I hope this book creates a small dent in improving the world because I believe no one is coming to save us. It’s up to us, as entrepreneurs, to innovate our way into a better world. And that’s something I’m willing to devote my life to. And I hope you are, too.</p>
      <p class="subsq">I’m grateful for your attention. You could have given it to anything, and you chose to invest it with me. I take it in high regard. So, sincerely, thank you.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Stay hungry,</p>
