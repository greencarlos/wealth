<h2 class="calibre102" id="calibre_pb_90"><strong class="calibre3">Twenty-Five Selected Case Studies</strong></h2><div class="calibre40"> </div>
<p class="calibre11">In <a href="CR%21Z2SBDSBFZN2NN907603NYYHXDBRV_split_014.html#filepos66417" class="calibre17">Chapter 2</a>, we met Barbara and John Varian, owners of the V6 Ranch in California. Barbara could have described her business in a typical fashion: “We have a ranch. People pay to visit and ride horses.” Instead, she said something much more powerful: “We help our guests become someone else, even if just for a day. Come stay with us and you’ll be a cowboy.” The difference between these two statements is huge! The first statement is merely descriptive, whereas the second evokes a powerful, emotional connection.</p>
<p class="calibre42">Like the V6 Ranch, every business has a way to describe itself in a traditional (i.e., boring) way and at least one much sexier way that stimulates a better response. There are two keys to remember in figuring out the difference for your own project:</p>
<div class="calibre30"><blockquote class="calibre20">
<p class="calibre54">1. Give people what they really want. Give them the fish!</p>
<p class="calibre54">2. Sell emotional benefits (“Be a cowboy”) instead of descriptive features (“Ride horses”).</p>
</blockquote></div><div class="calibre15"> </div>
<p class="calibre42">Here are twenty-five people from the study, all of whom found ways to differentiate between something merely descriptive and something that evokes a more passionate response.<a class="calibre43"></a></p>
