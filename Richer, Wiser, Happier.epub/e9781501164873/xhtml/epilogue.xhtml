<p class="chsub">Money matters. But it’s not the essential ingredient of an abundant life</p>
<p class="imageq"><img alt="Image" src="../images/common01.jpg"/></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote1">
<p class="chepi">If all you succeed in doing in life is getting rich by buying little pieces of paper, it’s a failed life. Life is more than being shrewd in wealth accumulation.</p>
<p class="chepiattn">—Charlie Munger</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="noindent">A television reporter once asked Bob Marley, “Are you a rich man?” The musician replied warily, “What you mean rich?” The reporter clarified his question: “You have a lot of possessions? A lot of money in the bank?” Marley responded with a question of his own: “Possessions make you rich? I don’t have that type of richness. My richness is life, forever.”</p>
<p class="indent">Over the last quarter of a century, I’ve spent an enormous amount of time interviewing and observing many of the world’s leading investors, and I’ve frequently found myself pondering this question of what makes a person rich. In a superficial sense, these investors are the ultimate winners. They have hit the jackpot on an almost unimaginable scale, enabling them to buy palatial properties, yachts, planes, and world-class collections of everything from art to race cars. But what does their wealth actually do for them? How much bearing does it have on their contentment? And if their physical riches are <i>not</i> the key to true abundance, then what is?</p>
<p class="indent">All those toys and trophies provide about as much joy as you’d expect—some, but not <i>that</i> much. Sir John Templeton once wrote, “Material assets bring comfort, but help little toward happiness or usefulness.… One of the real fallacies is the popular notion that happi<span aria-label="page 230" id="page_230" role="doc-pagebreak"/>ness depends on external circumstances and surroundings.” To a great extent, he was obviously right. You don’t have to be an enlightened Zen monk to recognize that physical pleasures offer an ephemeral and unreliable route to happiness. Still, I would note that Templeton himself chose to live in a beautiful house in the sun-kissed Bahamas, surrounded by the superrich. His choice suggests that external circumstances do have <i>some</i> influence on our sense of well-being.</p>
<p class="indent">Ed Thorp, a legendary gambler and investor who exudes joie de vivre, thinks with characteristic rationality about how best to structure his life in ways that improve his odds of being happy. One of his most life-enriching decisions was to buy a waterfront house in Newport Beach, California, with sublime views of sunsets over the Pacific Ocean. It’s “just a prime place to enjoy oneself,” says Thorp. “Why do I want to live in a congested, madhouse city with smog and filth and terrible weather and noise and a struggle to get from one place to the next? I’ll just live in a place where it’s sunny and pleasant, and I can exercise outdoors, and I can enjoy a lot of beauty, and I can go on hikes, sail, and I can scuba dive.”<sup class="sup"><a href="footnotes.xhtml#footnote-002" id="footnote-002-backlink">I</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Thorp, who started his career as a modestly paid math professor, appreciates the luxuries that investment success has afforded him. When I ask if he has any possessions that he loves, he grins and says, “I really enjoy my Tesla. It’s so much fun. It’s just the greatest car.” Still, he was never seduced by the fantasy that he’d become even happier if only he could amass <i>more</i> money, <i>more</i> houses, <i>more</i> cars, <i>more everything</i>. “Who you spend your time with is probably the most important thing in life,” says Thorp, who was widowed after fifty-five years of marriage and has since remarried. “People who just keep piling up stuff don’t get that. And they end up with a whole lot of stuff at the end, but they’ve spent their whole life just chasing it.”</p>
<p class="indent">As Thorp suggests, problems tend to arise when we become so consumed by the pursuit of money and possessions that we lose sight of what matters more. During his career as a hedge fund manager, Thorp could easily have gouged his shareholders and pocketed more of the <span aria-label="page 231" id="page_231" role="doc-pagebreak"/>spoils. Instead, he asked himself what he’d consider “fair and reasonable” if <i>he</i> were the client. He then designed his incentives so he’d earn nothing unless his clients made a profit. “People who don’t care about other people and are willing to do inconsistent, outrageous things and rip other people off seem to have an edge,” he says. “But to me, it’s maybe an edge in getting what they want. They can rip off more raw meat from the carcass of life. But they don’t live well and they don’t realize it. And when it’s all over, they’ve basically wasted their lives.”</p>
<p class="indent">All of this leads us to an important caveat. We need to be acutely aware of what we’re willing and unwilling to sacrifice for the sake of money. This might include rich relationships with our family and friends; talents and ambitions that we neglect at the expense of our fulfillment; the time to relish experiences that don’t advance us in a material way; or values that it’s tempting (and often profitable) to violate. When I ask Thorp if he has any regrets about the choices he’s made in his life, he says, “I don’t regret any of the <i>principled</i> choices I made.” It’s a reminder that one aspect of a successful and abundant life is the self-respect that comes from trying consistently (despite all of our flaws and failings) to behave decently and avoid harming others.</p>
<h2 class="h2x">The Freedom to Work Until You’re 109 Years Old</h2>
<p class="noindent">In 2015, Irving Kahn died at the astonishing age of 109. He’d lived through two world wars, the Crash of 1929, the Great Depression, the rise and fall of the Soviet Union, the invention of computers, and so much else. Benjamin Graham had been his mentor and friend, and had shared with him the secrets of intelligent investing. Kahn had drawn on that wisdom to build a respected investment firm, Kahn Brothers Group, where he worked alongside his son Thomas and grandson Andrew. Kahn was married for sixty-five years and had a busload of grandchildren and great-grandchildren. As I mentioned in a previous chapter, I typed out several questions for Kahn a few months before he died and gave them to Andrew, who wrote down his grandfather’s answers over several days.</p>
<p class="indent">Above all, I wanted to know what had been the key to a meaning<span aria-label="page 232" id="page_232" role="doc-pagebreak"/>ful and fulfilling life, and not just an extraordinarily long one. “It’s very hard to answer this question,” said Kahn. “Everyone will have a different answer. But for me, family has been very important.” And what gave him the most pride and pleasure when he looked back on his life? “Having a family, healthy children, seeing what we’ve achieved at the firm. These have all given me great pleasure,” he said. “I have also gotten pleasure from meeting people who are smarter than me and who gave me important answers. There are too many mysteries in life. At some point, you have to ask for directions.”</p>
<p class="indent">Just think for a moment about those basic ingredients that helped to make for a richly rewarding life. <i>Family Health Challenging and useful work</i>, which involved serving his clients well by compounding their savings conservatively over decades. And <i>learning</i>—particularly from Graham, an investment prophet who, Kahn said, “taught me how to study companies and succeed through research as opposed to luck or happenstance.”</p>
<p class="indent">For Kahn, much of the day-to-day pleasure of life came from intellectual discovery. He delighted in studying companies and reading about business, economics, politics, technology, and history. His sole indulgence was to buy thousands of books. He lived on a fraction of his income and never flaunted his wealth. He preferred hamburgers to lavish meals in chic restaurants and recalled with glee how, in the 1930s, he paid seventy-five cents to dine with his wife at his favorite Chinese restaurant. Even after turning one hundred, Kahn rode the bus to work several days a week. When I visited his office, I was struck by how nondescript it was. His utilitarian furniture looked tired and worn; his scuffed walls needed a coat of paint; and his most notable decoration was a bulletin board filled with dozens of family snapshots and an old picture of his teacher Graham.</p>
<p class="indent">“My father was interested in ideas,” says Thomas Kahn, who is now president of the family firm. “Most Wall Street guys are in it for the money. They want the custom suits.… They buy a place in Palm Beach, get a car and driver, get a jet. The objective for them is to spend. For Irving, that was not it.… He was never in it for the material things.” Most of all, he enjoyed “the satisfaction of being right and making good choices and doing better than others.”</p>
<p class="indent"><span aria-label="page 233" id="page_233" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Yet in some ways, money mattered immensely: it allowed Kahn to live and work precisely as he pleased. As Thomas Kahn puts it, “You build capital and then you can do whatever you want because you’re independent.” For many of the most successful investors I’ve interviewed, that freedom to construct a life that aligns authentically with their passions and peculiarities may be the single greatest luxury that money can buy. Bill Ackman, a billionaire known for his bold and controversial bets, once told me, “The most important personal driver for me very early on was independence. I wanted to be financially independent. I wanted to be independent enough to say what I thought. And I wanted to be independent enough to do what I thought was right.”</p>
<p class="indent">In his own quirky, low-key way, Kahn was true to himself. For most of us, the prospect of commuting as centenarians to an office tower in Manhattan has limited appeal. But Kahn had little interest in retirement—or, for that matter, visiting art galleries, going to the theater, or traveling for pleasure. “He enjoyed his work,” says Thomas Kahn. “It was his hobby.”</p>
<p class="indent">Equally important, Kahn’s wealth gave him peace of mind. His priority was never to maximize his returns, but to preserve his capital and make sustainable progress over many decades. He set aside a hefty cash reserve, which reduced his gains but insured that he’d never be forced to sell any of his investments prematurely in times of trouble. That stable foundation, along with his modest spending habits, allowed him to withstand any amount of economic turmoil. “If the market goes down, so what? You can still eat hamburger,” says Thomas Kahn. “It’s a really nice thing to be able to say, ‘Sure, I’m unhappy. But I’m not on the ledge like these other people.’ ”</p>
<p class="indent">That sense of deep-rooted security is a precious prize. During the global financial crisis of 2008–09, the journalism industry was eviscerated, and I lost my job as the editor of an international magazine at the same time as my investments took a shocking hit. With two kids in private school, plus the exorbitant cost of housing in London, I experienced firsthand the corrosive dread that I might be unable to take care of my family. Thankfully, I’d taken the precaution of avoiding debt. So I managed to ride out the crisis without selling any investments. Still, that traumatic period reinforced my conviction that nothing is more <span aria-label="page 234" id="page_234" role="doc-pagebreak"/>essential than our capacity to survive the most difficult times—not only financially, but emotionally. It’s easy to forget this when everything is going well.</p>
<p class="indent">Money can provide an invaluable cushion, a lifeline, a critical defense against uncertainty and misfortune. But it’s not enough. We also need the mental fortitude and resilience to weather those storms and rebuild in their wake. For most of us, the quality of our lives depends less on our finances than on inner attributes such as equanimity, acceptance, hope, trust, appreciation, and determined optimism. As John Milton wrote in <i>Paradise Lost</i>, which he dictated after going blind, “The mind is its own place, and in itself can make a heaven of Hell, a hell of Heaven.”</p>
<h2 class="h2x">“The Ability to Take Pain”</h2>
<p class="noindent">People often assume that celebrated investors have it made, that they exist within a cocoon of wealth and privilege that insulates them from most difficulties. But I’ve spent enough time with them to witness up close their troubles and sorrows, including bitter divorces, sick children, and periods of overwhelming stress. Their fortunes also depend heavily on the vagaries of the financial markets, which can be fickle and cruel, dashing their dreams, punishing their hubris, and exposing their flawed thinking for all to see and mock. Mohnish Pabrai remarks that all of the best investors share one indispensable trait: “the ability to take pain.”</p>
<p class="indent">In 2017, I met with Jason Karp in his sleek offices on the thirty-second floor of a New York skyscraper with commanding views over Central Park. Karp, then the CEO and chief investment officer of Tourbillon Capital Partners, was a rising star in the investment world. He’d graduated in the top four in his class at Wharton in 1998, become a high-flying portfolio manager at SAC Capital, and launched one of the hottest hedge fund start-ups in history. His firm scored impressive returns in its first three years and rapidly attracted more than $4 billion in assets. Handsome, charming, clever, and maniacally driven, Karp seemed destined for victory at everything he touched.</p>
<p class="indent"><span aria-label="page 235" id="page_235" role="doc-pagebreak"/>But his flagship fund lost 9.2 percent in 2016, battered in part by a failed bet that Valeant—a company sullied by scandal—would rebound once the market recognized that it wasn’t <i>quite</i> as toxic as it seemed. Meanwhile, the S&amp;P 500 returned 12 percent. It was the worst year in Karp’s eighteen-year career. What’s more, 2017 was off to a lousy start, and he’d finish it with a 13.8 percent loss. Karp spoke with disarming candor about the impact of his first encounter with failure. “Last year was very humbling,” he said. “I took it very personally, and I got a lot of heat.… I felt like I was apologizing the whole year, which was sort of unusual, and there was a lot of self-doubt about what just happened. Did I just get bad? Did I get stupid? Am I losing it?”</p>
<p class="indent">In the past, said Karp, there had been periods when his returns were “almost unthinkably good. Everyone wants to know what your secret sauce is. Why are you so amazing? It really goes to your head.” Now it felt as if he’d tumbled “from the absolute top to the absolute bottom. It was almost like they’d expected us to be immortal.… And then we showed our mortality.”</p>
<p class="indent">Growing up in the 1980s, Karp had played video games so obsessively that it bordered on being “totally unhealthy.” But he now regarded that misspent youth as a “very formative and helpful” preparation for his investment career. “One of the nice things about video games as a metaphor is that you die all the time,” he explained. “You play, you play, you play, you die. You play, you play, you die.” It’s a harmless way of learning “to accept constant loss and defeat over and over again. And it doesn’t bother you. You just keep doing it. And that’s what investing is.”</p>
<p class="indent">The trouble with managing money for other people, said Karp, is that “you’re constantly under scrutiny. You’re constantly compared to everyone else.” Yet in the short term, your returns provide an unreliable reflection of your talent, your work ethic, and your long-term prospects. “You’re being judged every week on something you have no control over.”</p>
<p class="indent">That lack of control can be excruciating. Karp adhered to a logical and consistent investment process. But he started to develop a “very, <i>very</i> uncomfortable feeling” that there was no “clear linkage between process and outcome.” He remarked that scientists have been known to “induce insanity” in animals during laboratory experiments by entic<span aria-label="page 236" id="page_236" role="doc-pagebreak"/>ing them to pull a lever repeatedly and responding randomly, either with a treat or an electric shock. As an active trader in a violently volatile and irrational market, he had come to identify with those unfortunate creatures.</p>
<p class="indent">“There’s so much randomness that it can drive you insane,” said Karp. “It requires a certain type of masochistic, weirdly wired human to do this [job] for a very long period of time.… It’s almost akin to subjecting yourself to torture over and over and over again. Because when you get it right, it feels great. But you get it wrong often. And you have to keep coming back.”</p>
<p class="indent">Karp recognized that resilience is a prerequisite for success in markets and life. A competitive athlete, he’d been an Academic All-American and All-Ivy squash player in college. Then, in his early twenties, he’d developed several life-threatening autoimmune diseases and been told by his doctors that he’d lose his sight by the age of thirty. To their surprise, he recovered completely after radically altering his approach to nutrition, sleep, and stress management. Obsessed with health and sustainable excellence, he’d designed Tourbillon’s offices to include a gym, a meditation room, and a kitchen stocked with nutritious food. He’d even banned soda from the premises. When it came to hiring, he specifically recruited people with a proven ability to recover from setbacks, using a former CIA interrogator to help him with the selection process.</p>
<p class="indent">But in 2018, Karp decided that he’d had enough. He felt that his “personal edge was gone,” that he added no significant value in a market increasingly dominated by index funds and machine-driven trading. He could have kept going and collected extravagant fees for a couple more years, but he couldn’t bear to be mediocre. So he closed his funds, returned about $1.5 billion to his shareholders, and quit the hedge fund business.</p>
<p class="indent">When I caught up with him again in 2020, Karp told me, “I was fully clinically depressed for my last few years at Tourbillon, and I was even clinically depressed when I was at the height of my success.” The money, the plaudits, and the glamorous lifestyle had all failed to make him happy. “I’ve obviously earned enough to retire many times over,” he said. “But for me, it always felt a bit hollow.… I felt that my soul was <span aria-label="page 237" id="page_237" role="doc-pagebreak"/>decaying.” As a trader racing endlessly from one short-term bet to the next, he also sensed that his job had become an addiction. “It was just this compulsive game of winning at pushing prices around.… I wasn’t actually building anything.”</p>
<p class="indent">Karp had turned his life around before. In his twenties, he restored his health by embracing an “ultraclean” lifestyle free from processed food, alcohol, caffeine, and even brands of shampoo or deodorant containing chemicals. In his forties, he’s reinventing himself again. Determined to create something of “enduring value,” he recently unveiled his new venture—a private holding company called HumanCo, which will back and nurture businesses that “help people to live healthier lives.” It’s a specialized niche in which he’s convinced that he has an edge. Plus, his company’s focus on clean living and sustainability aligns deeply with his values.</p>
<p class="indent">Starting over, Karp has also left Manhattan and moved with his wife and kids to Austin, Texas—“a health-and-wellness mecca” with “better weather,” “more outdoor living,” “no state or city taxes,” and “this positivity that the jaded New York finance crew didn’t have.” It turns out that what he craved most wasn’t money, but a balanced and healthy life, a chance to build a “mission-driven” company that helps others, and a greater sense of control over his destiny. So how does he feel? Karp confides, “I’m the healthiest and happiest I’ve been in twenty years.”</p>
<h2 class="h2x">Stocks and Stoics</h2>
<p class="noindent">From time to time, all of the best investors mess up or get unlucky, no matter how careful and diligent they may be. After all, the financial markets are a microcosm of life: infinitely complex and wildly unpredictable. When Joel Greenblatt launched his investment firm in 1985, the first merger deal in which he invested involved Florida Cypress Gardens, which operated a tourist attraction with exotic gardens, flamingos, and aquatic shows featuring Santa Claus on water skis. The company agreed to be acquired, and Greenblatt made what he describes as “a pretty riskless” arbitrage bet that the deal would close as planned. Then, one morning, he opened the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> to <span aria-label="page 238" id="page_238" role="doc-pagebreak"/>discover that the company’s main pavilion had fallen into a sinkhole. The deal collapsed, and he suffered a major loss at a vulnerable time when he was “counting every nickel.” Greenblatt remarks, “It would have been funny, if I hadn’t been scared out of my mind.”</p>
<p class="indent">In short, we are all subject to what Hamlet called “the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune.” We cannot hope to lead happy and successful lives unless we learn to cope well with adversity. In challenging times, Pabrai attempts to clone the mindset of Marcus Aurelius, a second-century Roman emperor and Stoic philosopher whose notes to himself are preserved in <i>Meditations</i>, a book that he never intended to publish. As Marcus Aurelius saw it, “the greatest of all contests” is “the struggle not to be overwhelmed by anything that happens.” But how?</p>
<p class="indent">The key, he wrote, is to “concentrate on this for your whole life long: for your mind to be in the right state.” That includes “welcoming wholeheartedly whatever comes,” “trusting that all is for the best,” and “not worrying too often, or with any selfish motive, about what other people say. Or do, or think.” Marcus Aurelius considered it futile to fret or complain about anything beyond his control. He focused instead on mastering his own thoughts and behaving virtuously so he would meet his moral obligations. “Disturbance comes only from within—from our own perceptions,” he argued. “Choose not to be harmed—and you won’t feel harmed. Don’t feel harmed—and you haven’t been. It can ruin your life only if it ruins your character. Otherwise it cannot harm you.” He sought “to be like the rock that the waves keep crashing over. It stands unmoved and the raging of the sea falls still around it.”</p>
<p class="indent">It’s not hard to see why many top-notch investors are attracted to Stoicism—none more so than Bill Miller, who studied philosophy as a postgraduate at Johns Hopkins and announced in 2018 that he was donating $75 million to the university’s philosophy department. During the financial crisis, he suffered a reversal of fortune that might have permanently derailed an investor without his reserves of Stoic endurance.</p>
<p class="indent">Back then, Miller was the preeminent mutual fund manager of his generation. His main fund, Legg Mason Value Trust, had famously beaten the S&amp;P 500 for fifteen years running. But as the market crashed in 2008, he made the gravest analytical error of his career. He bet that a slew of the worst-hit financial stocks would soar once the Federal Reserve acted <span aria-label="page 239" id="page_239" role="doc-pagebreak"/>decisively to inject capital and avert catastrophe. He loaded up on radioactive stocks such as Bear Stearns, AIG, Merrill Lynch, Freddie Mac, and Countrywide Financial—all of which continued to melt down. In 2008, Value Trust lost 55 percent. His smaller fund fell 65 percent.</p>
<p class="indent">Investors fled. Miller’s assets under management plunged from around $77 billion to $800 million. And as the business withered, about a hundred members of his team lost their jobs. Half of Miller’s net worth had already been vaporized in his recent divorce, and he lost 80 percent of the remaining half when the market imploded, thanks to his incorrigible habit of investing on margin. Miller, who “grew up without any money” as the son of a taxi driver, remarks, “I don’t really care about losing <i>my</i> money.” But he was tormented by the thought of all the misery he was inflicting on others. “Laying off all those people was horrible.… That was the worst part of it: losing money for clients, and people losing their jobs because <i>I</i> screwed up.”</p>
<p class="indent">Miller, who spent several years in military intelligence before becoming an investor, describes himself as “very emotionless.” When stocks sink, his default mode is to remain calm and cheerful, actively welcoming the opportunity to profit from other investors’ emotional disarray. But the pressure was so unrelenting during the crisis that he gained forty pounds. “When I get stressed, I eat or drink,” he confesses. “I wasn’t about to eat salmon and broccoli every night and drink mineral water.… There’s only so much pain I can take, and I drew the line there.”</p>
<p class="indent">Miller draws on philosophy in every area of his life. When I first interviewed him twenty years ago, he explained how Ludwig Wittgenstein and William James taught him to think, helping him to distinguish between perception and reality. Now, with his career, his finances, his reputation, and his peace of mind under attack, he turned for “emotional stability” to Stoic philosophers such as Epictetus and Seneca, reminding himself of their “general approach to misfortune. Basically, you can’t control what happens to you,” says Miller. “You <i>can</i> control your attitude towards it. Whether it’s good, bad, indifferent, fair, unfair, you can choose the attitude you take to it.”</p>
<p class="indent">Miller also reread <i>Thoughts of a Philosophical Fighter Pilot</i>, which recounts Vice Admiral Jim Stockdale’s experiences as a prisoner of war <span aria-label="page 240" id="page_240" role="doc-pagebreak"/>after he was shot down over Vietnam in 1965. As he ejected from his burning plane and parachuted into enemy territory, Stockdale whispered to himself, “I’m leaving the world of technology and entering the world of Epictetus.” He spent the next seven and a half years in captivity, including four years in solitary confinement and two years in leg chains. He was tortured fifteen times.</p>
<p class="indent">Epictetus, who was born into slavery, provided a path to mental freedom under any conditions. He taught that we can never be certain of controlling anything external, including our health, wealth, and social status. However, we can take total responsibility for our intentions, emotions, and attitudes. “It is <i>within you</i>,” he declared, “that both your destruction and deliverance lie.”</p>
<p class="indent">Stockdale could not prevent his jailors from torturing him until he confessed. But he fought valiantly to defend his “inner self.” When marched at gunpoint to be interrogated, he chanted a mantra to himself: “Control fear, control guilt.” He also insisted that American prisoners must not bow in public to their captors or accept early release. “To the Stoic, the <i>greatest</i> injury that can be inflicted on a person is administered by <i>himself</i> when he destroys the good man within him,” he wrote. “You can only be a ‘victim’ of <i>yourself</i>. It’s all how you discipline your mind.”</p>
<p class="indent">Faced with the worst defeat of his career, Miller focused on what he could control and tried to let go of the rest. He was publicly shamed in the press and derided on social media. “I’m not happy when people write how stupid I am,” he says. But as he’d learned from the Stoics, “you can’t control what other people are going to say about you or think about you. You just control your reactions.” His reaction was to “try to be straightforward, honest, admit mistakes,” and do his best to fix what he had broken. “It certainly isn’t important to me to vindicate a reputation. It was important to me basically to get my clients’ money back that I’d lost them, if I could do that.”</p>
<p class="indent">Miller had no doubt that his strategy of buying stocks “at large discounts to what they’re worth… ought to work over time.” And he’d proven to himself over two decades that he could “tell the difference between things that are cheap and things that are expensive.” So he kept plugging away, first at Legg Mason, and then at a new firm of his <span aria-label="page 241" id="page_241" role="doc-pagebreak"/>own, Miller Value Partners. Still, he had the humility to recognize that he needed to diversify his mutual funds more broadly than he’d previously realized. “I’m much more sensitive to risk and being wrong than I was before,” he says. “It’s an admission that I didn’t think I could be as catastrophically wrong as I was.”</p>
<p class="indent">Investors who maintained their faith in Miller have profited richly since the financial crisis. His flagship mutual fund, Miller Opportunity Trust, ranked in the top 1 percent of all US equity funds over the following decade. Meanwhile, Miller’s own fortune has also leaped to new heights. It helped that he had the gumption to buy more stocks during the meltdown, investing cash that he raised in part by selling his yacht (though not his plane, <i>never</i> his plane).</p>
<p class="indent">But the biggest score of all has come from his immense personal stake in Amazon, which he’s owned for more than two decades. He added aggressively to his Amazon position after the dot-com bubble burst in 2001, and he then supercharged his bet by investing in options when the stock tanked again during the financial crisis. Miller believes that he’s now the single-largest individual shareholder of Amazon who was never a member of the Bezos family. In 2020, Miller told me that Amazon had grown to 83 percent of his personal investment portfolio.<sup class="sup"><a href="footnotes.xhtml#footnote-001" id="footnote-001-backlink">II</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Looking back on the financial crisis after all these years, Miller admits that “the pain and disappointment haven’t faded at all.” But he’s pleased that almost all of his laid-off employees found new jobs quickly; that he didn’t have so much leverage that it “would take me out of the game and cause me ruin”; and that he found the strength to continue buying cheap stocks even in the darkest days, instead of hiding “like a turtle under the shell when I lost all that money.”</p>
<p class="indent">In personal terms, adds Miller, the crisis was “very cleansing.” It’s hard to remain humble when you’ve been “right, right, right” and “people keep telling you that you’re wonderful.… Some of it seeps through.” As a prominent investor, you’re frequently invited to “pontificate about everything.” But when you’ve been “massively wrong” and “you’re getting crushed in the market, no one wants to hear about what you think. <span aria-label="page 242" id="page_242" role="doc-pagebreak"/>You’re really forced to look internally and confront your mistakes and see if you can do better. And it’s good for the ego.”</p>
<p class="indent">Now that the storm has passed, Miller, who recently turned seventy, leads a radically simplified life. He oversees $2.5 billion in assets—a tiny sliver of what he once invested. But he has no desire to build a complicated business with a swarm of analysts and mountains of money to manage. He prefers to work with a handful of trusted allies, including his son. As the owner of the firm, Miller has “a huge amount of freedom,” which he lacked at Legg Mason, a large public company where “the scrutiny became very intense.” He no longer has to explain himself at board meetings. His standard attire is a pair of jeans and a T-shirt. His calendar is mostly empty, leaving him free to focus on the essence of his job: “trying to add value to clients every month.”</p>
<p class="indent">Miller’s wealth enables him to avoid many of the inconveniences that could distract him from that task, such as filling his car with gas, flying on commercial airlines, or figuring out how to decorate his homes in Florida and Maryland. “I control my time and the content,” he says. Invited to speak at a black-tie gala, he declined, explaining that he’d thrown away his tuxedo and will never buy another one. For Miller, nothing beats being able to live and invest his own way—unconstrained, independent, beholden to nobody. “Oh, yeah,” he says. “That’s the best.”</p>
<p class="indent">For me, Miller’s story offers two valuable lessons. First, everyone suffers. When I’m struggling myself, it’s reassuring to remember that Miller, Karp, Pabrai, and everyone else I’ve interviewed have been through the wringer, no matter how rich or renowned they may be. There’s an old saying, sometimes attributed to Philo of Alexandria: “Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a hard battle.” Nobody has an untroubled upward trajectory, and there are times when we all need additional support—from philosophy, spirituality, family, friends, or wherever else we can find it. If we dream that untold riches will somehow free us from mental suffering, we’re setting ourselves up for disappointment. Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche, a Tibetan Buddhist master who was a teacher of the Dalai Lama, once said, “Those who seek happiness in pleasure, wealth, glory, power, and heroics are as naive as the child who tries to catch a rainbow and wear it as a coat.”</p>
<p class="indent"><span aria-label="page 243" id="page_243" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Second, there’s great honor in the simple virtue of perseverance. Several years ago, I wrote to Pabrai during a painful period when he was beset with challenges on multiple fronts, including the bankruptcy of one of his largest investments, Horsehead Holdings. He replied, “Marcus Aurelius is my hero here. We cannot see it when it is happening, but facing adversity is a blessing. It eventually leads to higher highs.” Pabrai’s invincible optimism reminded me of a glorious line from <i>Meditations</i>: “So remember this principle when something threatens to cause you pain: the thing itself was no misfortune at all; to endure it and prevail is great good fortune.”</p>
<h2 class="h2x">“I’m the Richest Guy in the World”</h2>
<p class="noindent">When I think about what constitutes a successful and abundant life, the investor who embodies it best for me is Arnold Van Den Berg. He’s not a billionaire or a genius. He doesn’t own a yacht or a plane. Yet there’s nobody in the investment world whom I admire more. If I had to choose just one role model from all of the remarkable investors I’ve interviewed over the last quarter of a century, it would be him. He was dealt a terrible hand, but has defied overwhelming odds to achieve a life of prosperity that goes far beyond money.</p>
<p class="indent">Born into a Jewish family in 1939, Van Den Berg lived on the same street in Amsterdam as Anne Frank. The following year, Germany invaded the Netherlands and set about annihilating its population of 140,000 Jews. By 1945, only 38,000 had survived. Van Den Berg’s parents hid for almost two years in the home of non-Jewish friends, Hank and Marie Bunt, who built a secret closet for them behind a double wall. But there was a terrifying risk that Arnold or his older brother, Sigmund, would make a noise if the Nazis came to search the house. If discovered, they would all be deported to concentration camps, where children were often the first to be killed. So Van Den Berg’s parents took a desperate gamble. They arranged for their sons to be smuggled out of Amsterdam by the Dutch underground, using fake identity papers.</p>
<p class="indent">The rescue network involved three courageous families named Tjaden, Glasz, and Crommelin, who risked their own lives to protect <span aria-label="page 244" id="page_244" role="doc-pagebreak"/>the two boys, shuffling them secretly from one hiding place to the next. Half a century later, a Dutch woman named Olga Crommelin would write a letter recounting how she took Arnold by train and foot to a rural village where he would be hidden in a Christian orphanage along with several other Jewish children. At the time, she was about seventeen, and he was two. “I shall never forget that when the train pulled in at that station where we had to get off, there was a small group of SS men on the platform and it gave me quite a shock,” recalled Crommelin. Immersed in conversation, these members of Hitler’s murderous security force took no notice of the Jewish toddler and the teenage girl who dared to save his life.</p>
<p class="indent">Van Den Berg lived in the orphanage until he was six. For many years, he believed that he’d been sent away because his mother didn’t want him. He also suffered the trauma of separation from his brother, who was given refuge by a childless couple who lived on a farm. Conditions in the orphanage were dire, with so little food and water that Van Den Berg sometimes resorted to eating plants that he found in the fields. “I almost died of malnutrition,” he says. “At age six, I could barely walk. I used to crawl most of the time.… Truly, it’s a miracle that I made it.”</p>
<p class="indent">One day in 1944, Van Den Berg’s parents ventured out of their hiding place to visit a woman from the resistance movement who could tell them how Arnold and Sigmund were faring in the countryside. An air raid siren sounded while they were on the street, and they took cover inside a butcher’s shop. A Nazi collaborator working there realized that Van Den Berg’s parents were Jewish and betrayed them to the police. They were arrested, interrogated, and sent to Auschwitz.</p>
<p class="indent">Thirty-nine members of Van Den Berg’s family perished in the Holocaust. But both of his parents survived.<sup class="sup"><a href="footnotes.xhtml#footnote-000" id="footnote-000-backlink">III</a></sup> After the war, they reunited at the Bunts’ home and traveled to the orphanage to retrieve their son. “I didn’t remember that they were my parents. I didn’t recognize them, and I really didn’t care. I just wanted to get out of there,” says Van Den Berg. “My dad said that, in another few months, I would probably have died. He was afraid to pick me up because my bones stuck through my skin so much that he was afraid he’d break them.”</p>
<p class="indent"><span aria-label="page 245" id="page_245" role="doc-pagebreak"/>A few years later, the family emigrated to a poor and threatening neighborhood in East Los Angeles. “I was a very weak, skinny kid,” says Van Den Berg. “There’s a lot of bullying that goes on if you’re the weak one. You’re the prey.” When he started at his new school, his mother dressed him impeccably in lederhosen and long socks, landing him in several fights on his first day. Another formative experience came when he was shoved into a young thug who demanded that they fight in the bicycle yard at their high school. “I wouldn’t have been any more scared if they’d put me in front of a firing squad,” says Van Den Berg. “He beat the hell out of me till he got tired of hitting me. I literally didn’t offer any resistance.”</p>
<p class="indent">Back home, he washed the blood off his face and appraised the damage. “I had an epiphany. I thought, ‘My God! I’ve been so afraid of this, and this is not that bad. Just think if I would have fought back. It couldn’t have got any worse.… Immediately, I got rid of all my fears of fighting. It was just gone. It was an amazing transformation.”</p>
<p class="indent">Determined to stand up for himself, he learned to box and soon discovered the benefits of throwing the first punch. He had so much rage in him—against the Nazis, against the bullies at school, against the anti-Semites who targeted him as he walked home, and against his parents—that he became a fearsome fighter. His three best friends were tough kids from violent homes, who leaped to each other’s defense in countless battles. His mother yelled at them and sprayed them with a hose. But they would all soften with age, and they remain close in their eighties.</p>
<p class="indent">Van Den Berg gradually built his strength by climbing ropes, which was an Olympic sport in those days. After six months of practicing for two hours a day, he raced against a nemesis who had never climbed, hoping to demonstrate his new power. “He beat me so bad that I almost cried right there on the spot,” says Van Den Berg. “I was so embarrassed.… Then something flashed in my mind: You wanted to get stronger and you are <i>getting</i> stronger. So why would you quit?”</p>
<p class="indent">His coach sent him to observe a champion from another school who had developed an innovative climbing technique. Van Den Berg was mesmerized. For months, he rose in the middle of the night and mimicked those movements compulsively in front of a mirror until they <span aria-label="page 246" id="page_246" role="doc-pagebreak"/>became embedded in his mind and body. He kept repeating to himself, “I am the number one man in the league.” In the years that followed, he transformed himself into a star athlete, breaking school records by scaling a twenty-foot rope in 3.5 seconds, becoming the league champion three times, and competing nationally against climbers who were already in college. It was his first taste of success, his first hint of what he could achieve with relentless work and single-minded belief.</p>
<p class="indent">Academically, he was still a disaster. He was emotionally troubled, couldn’t concentrate in class, and found it difficult to learn. “I was showing signs of not being too bright, I guess, so my mom hired one of the top psychologists because she thought maybe something happened because of the war,” says Van Den Berg. He overheard the psychologist speculating that all those years of malnutrition may have damaged Van Den Berg’s brain during a critical stage in his early development.</p>
<p class="indent">“So I always had this image of myself as not very smart,” says Van Den Berg. “Look, if I was to send you my high school report card, you would have a big laugh. I had two periods of auto shop my last year. Two periods of gymnastics. A study hall. For what? I used to do my isometrics exercises in my study hall. Then I had a cappella, and I have such a bad aptitude for singing that my a cappella teacher would make me just move my mouth during performances because he didn’t want me to throw the whole team off.… I don’t have any innate talents for anything. No. Everything I’ve ever accomplished has taken more effort than anybody else.”</p>
<p class="indent">Van Den Berg’s father, a scrupulously honest but hard man who hit him until he finally hit back, made his sons pay for their own food, clothes, and entertainment once they turned thirteen. Van Den Berg mowed lawns, washed cars, delivered newspapers, pumped gas, worked in a garbage truck, then landed a job in a wood factory for four hours a day after class.</p>
<p class="indent">At sixteen, while saving for a car, he sold flowers with such success that he earned the right to hawk them on the most prized street corner. That day, it poured torrentially. Drenched, miserable, and stunned by his bad luck, he still refused to stop selling. A stranger who was driving past bought all of his flowers, so he would get out of the rain before catching a cold. She drove him to her home, gave him a dry shirt, and <span aria-label="page 247" id="page_247" role="doc-pagebreak"/>made soup to warm him up. “I’ve never forgotten her,” says Van Den Berg. “That woman touched my heart.… When someone touches your heart, you’re never going to be the same.”</p>
<p class="indent">Having barely scraped through high school, Van Den Berg didn’t bother with college. He worked in a printing store, where he was promoted to supervisor, joined an insurance company, where he peddled policies door-to-door, and later sold mutual funds for a financial services firm. Along the way, he married his high school girlfriend, but she left him for another man. During a period of deep depression that lasted for several years, Van Den Berg began to see a psychiatrist. He knew that he was lucky to be alive, since so few Jewish children from Holland had survived the war. But he was trapped inside his own head. “I was the personification of anger,” he says. He was furious at his ex-wife and tormented by the Holocaust.</p>
<p class="indent">For years, he had struggled to understand why that teenage girl in Amsterdam had saved him. How could she have been “willing to sacrifice her life” for “somebody she didn’t even know?” And how could her parents have allowed her to embark on such a “suicide mission?” Van Den Berg’s psychiatrist told him, “It’s simple. If your life is more important than your principles, you sacrifice your principles. If your principles are more important than your life, you sacrifice your life.” That insight “had a profound effect on me,” says Van Den Berg. He developed an intense desire “to do something with my life” and to live it by principles that were worthy of his saviors.</p>
<p class="indent">During the years when he was selling funds, Van Den Berg became captivated by the stock market and began to explore why some investors performed better than others. That led him to study Ben Graham’s books. The concept of buying assets at a steep discount resonated instantly. Van Den Berg’s mother, a shrewd businesswoman who had survived in Auschwitz by trading goods and paying guards to provide her and her husband with extra bread, had always stressed that it was dumb to buy anything for the full retail price. It seemed natural to apply her rule to stocks. After a dishonest colleague was honored as Man of the Month, Van Den Berg quit his job and decided to launch his own investment firm. It was 1974. He was thirty-five years old. He had no college degree, no relevant experience, no business plan, no office, no clients.</p>
<p class="indent"><span aria-label="page 248" id="page_248" role="doc-pagebreak"/>But he approached his new vocation with the same all-consuming commitment that he’d applied to rope climbing. His psychiatrist told him that he had triumphed back then by adopting mental strategies that professional athletes used routinely—setting clearly defined goals, visualizing themselves performing flawlessly, and repeating affirmations that crowded out all doubts and fears until they were replaced with unshakable self-belief. Van Den Berg became obsessed with such techniques for harnessing the power of the subconscious mind, making himself a human guinea pig in an experiment that has never stopped. He learned to hypnotize himself every day as a way of focusing his scattered thoughts. He flooded his mind with uplifting affirmations, gradually ridding himself of the debilitating belief that he was incapable and unworthy. And he devoured inspirational works by authors such as James Allen, returning again and again to a 1901 book that he came to regard as his bible: <i>From Poverty to Power</i>.</p>
<p class="indent">Allen, a freethinker steeped in Christianity and Buddhism, convinced Van Den Berg to take responsibility for his own mental state; to forgive everyone who had hurt him, including the Nazis, thereby liberating himself from his own anger; and to reform the world by focusing first on reforming himself. “By your own thoughts you make or mar your life, your world, your universe,” Allen preached. “As you build within by the power of thought, so will your outward life and circumstances shape themselves accordingly.… The soul that is impure, sordid, and selfish is gravitating with unerring precision toward misfortune and catastrophe; the soul that is pure, unselfish, and noble is gravitating with equal precision toward happiness and prosperity.”</p>
<p class="indent">Desperate to improve his circumstances, Van Den Berg made a total commitment to improve his character. He became a lifelong explorer of wisdom from many spiritual paths, vowing to pursue the truth wherever it led him. Honesty and integrity became guiding principles, and he took to heart Allen’s assertion that “the rich man who is barren of virtue is, in reality, poor.” Van Den Berg no longer allowed negative thoughts about himself or others to linger in his mind and drain his energy. Where once he’d been consumed by resentment and hostility, he now rebuilt himself from the inside by constantly repeating positive phrases such as “I am a loving person.”</p>
<p class="indent"><span aria-label="page 249" id="page_249" role="doc-pagebreak"/>He had none of the skepticism or cynicism of a college-educated intellectual snob. He believed absolutely that he could create a golden future by consciously reprogramming his mind. What set him apart was his unflagging persistence and his insatiable desire to make himself a better man. “I always want to be working on self-improvement until the day I die,” he says. “After it’s all said and done, these are the three most important things to me. Never compromise what you believe in. Never be satisfied with what you are, only with what you can be. And never give up.”</p>
<p class="indent">Van Den Berg cut out a photograph from <i>Barron’s</i> of an eminent investor standing confidently beside his desk while dressed immaculately in a three-piece suit. He gazed at that image every day, using it to help visualize himself as a successful money manager. He set himself a target of averaging 15 percent a year without losing more than 15 percent in any year—a goal that he actually achieved over the next three decades. He removed the clutter from his studio apartment, placed a desk in the middle, and surrounded himself with investment books. He gave up chess, which he loved, because it divided his attention. He played golf just once and concluded, “This is a game I won’t get into because it will shackle my mind.” When a girlfriend asked if she could cook him dinner, he informed her that he had to study. She accused him of behaving like a monk.</p>
<p class="indent">Van Den Berg developed a consistent investment methodology that was infused with common sense. Among other things, he analyzed hundreds of acquisitions to construct a record of what sophisticated private buyers would pay for various types of business. He then formulated a few practical rules of thumb that he refused to violate. For example, he wouldn’t invest in any stock unless it traded for at least 50 percent less than its private market value. And whenever a stock rose to 80 percent of its private market value, he insisted on selling.</p>
<p class="indent">His unswerving discipline and rigorous focus on valuations kept him on the right track. Most investors shunned stocks in the aftermath of the 1974 crash. But prices were so low that he didn’t hesitate to buy, enabling him to generate powerful returns during his first decade in the business. Then, when prices surged in the bubble of 1987, he could find nothing cheap enough to replace the stocks that his ironclad rules <span aria-label="page 250" id="page_250" role="doc-pagebreak"/>required him to sell. Before long, his growing roster of clients had half of their assets in cash. Many were livid. Still, he never flinched, telling himself, “You’re doing the right thing to stick to your discipline.… Now, you may go out of business, but you’re doing the right thing. And that immediately brought me comfort.” Soon afterward, the market crashed 22.6 percent in one day. “Everyone was panicking, and I was like a kid in a candy store.”</p>
<p class="indent">It took more than a decade for Van Den Berg’s firm, Century Management, to become solidly profitable. During those lean years, he fell in love and remarried. At the time, he was $20,000 in debt and could hardly support himself, let alone his new wife, Eileen, and her two young kids. Before long, they had a third child. They crammed into a fifteen-hundred-square-foot house in LA, using the garage as an extra bedroom. Then they bought a modest home in Austin, Texas, for about $350,000 and have lived there ever since. “I wouldn’t sell it,” says Van Den Berg. “We love it.”</p>
<p class="indent">As his business expanded, Van Den Berg became wealthier and more renowned than he’d ever envisioned. He was featured in a book titled <i>The World’s 99 Greatest Investors</i>, which hailed him for the rare feat of averaging 14.2 percent annually over thirty-eight years. A string of major asset managers sought to buy his company. He could probably have cashed out for more than $100 million. But how could he trust these smooth-talking corporate suitors to act in his clients’ best interests, instead of their own? When four emissaries from a bank tried to convince him to sell his firm, he told them, “I’m not selling at any price. I’d close it down before I’d sell it.”</p>
<p class="indent">In truth, he had never yearned to become seriously rich. Starting out, his aim was to build a nest egg of $250,000—enough to support himself for ten years. “I didn’t care if I made millions,” he says. “I just wanted to be financially independent and not take any shit off anybody.… The luxury is not having to worry about money or a bill or a financial setback.”</p>
<p class="indent">For a person in his position, his lifestyle is decidedly understated. “I’ve never had any need for material things,” he says. “I have no interest in anything like a big home.… That turns me off.” A vegetarian teetotaler with a passion for yoga, he prefers to sip beetroot smoothies <span aria-label="page 251" id="page_251" role="doc-pagebreak"/>in his book-filled office than to feast in elegant restaurants. “I’m really not into clothes,” he adds. “I have three suits.” For many years, he drove a Nissan Maxima because “it was the best value you could get in a car.” When one of his children asked why he didn’t buy a Mercedes, he explained that he didn’t want to “make a statement” by driving a flashy car: “I wouldn’t want to be associated with people who think that way.” A few years ago, his wife finally persuaded him to part with his ten-year-old Acura and upgrade to a Lexus. “She was so thrilled to get it for me that I didn’t want to say no because she got all excited,” he recalls. “I was almost embarrassed to drive it at first.”</p>
<p class="indent">Once he felt “completely secure” about his financial future, no amount of money he could earn would make any difference to him. “I’m the richest guy in the world because I’m content with what I have,” says Van Den Berg. “I feel wealthier not because I have more money but because I’ve got health, good friendships, I’ve got a great family. Prosperity takes all of these things into consideration: health, wealth, happiness, peace of mind. That’s what a prosperous person is, not just a lot of money. That doesn’t mean anything.” He recalls a former client with $10 million “who was so eager for the money that he would call me collect” to save a few cents.</p>
<p class="indent">“The most important thing people need is love—and the less love they have, the more they need these material things,” says Van Den Berg. “They look for money, for some accomplishment, or something external to validate them. But all they need to do is be loved and to give love. You know, my wife never knows how much money we have. She never cares and she never thinks about it other than how she could use it to spend it on somebody.”</p>
<p class="indent">One of their favorite causes is a residential treatment center for abused and neglected children. Van Den Berg and his wife have bought books and toys for hundreds of these kids, and she worked closely with them for twenty years. He has also quietly helped many people with financial difficulties, typically assisting in small but significant ways—paying for a class that enabled them to earn a better living or footing a medical bill for a sick child. Being able to help others, says Van Den Berg, is “the greatest blessing the money has given me.”</p>
<p class="indent">Having observed over several years how he interacts with other peo<span aria-label="page 252" id="page_252" role="doc-pagebreak"/>ple, what impresses me most is the sheer joy that he takes in trying to guide, support, and inspire them. He delights in hypnotizing people (including me) and seeking to instill positive suggestions in the subconscious mind while they lie on his office floor in a state of deep relaxation. He becomes irrepressibly excited as he recalls various highlights of his adventures in hypnotism, including a time when his son, Scott, won a shot-put championship under hypnosis, despite having a sprained ankle in a cast. Van Den Berg loves giving talks to disadvantaged kids, college students, and prison inmates about the lessons he’s learned from the Holocaust and his own struggles. And he is constantly gifting books that have helped him on his journey, including a special edition of <i>From Poverty to Power</i> that he paid to reprint. “I feel that the best gift I could give anybody, whether they’re poor or rich, is to give them a book that could change their life,” he says. “And so my hobby is giving out books.”</p>
<p class="indent">Van Den Berg often wonders why he survived the Holocaust. “Was it just luck?” he asks. “You could say, yeah, because I’m just one of the statistics. But somehow, I’ve always had this feeling that there was a purpose to my life, that I was spared. And so I want to change people’s lives. Not to my way of thinking. Just to make it better.”</p>
<p class="indent">Tucked away inside the filing cabinets in his office, he keeps what might just be his most valuable possession: a copious collection of heartfelt letters from many of the people he has helped, including countless friends, clients, random strangers, and his own children. “The pleasure you get out of knowing you’ve made a difference in people’s lives—that’s something that nobody can take away from you,” he says. “I could lose all my money, and I could still go to these files and say, ‘Well, it’s not like I lived my life for nothing. Look at the people whose lives I’ve changed.’ ” Van Den Berg points to his trove of letters and says, “That’s my bank account.”</p>
